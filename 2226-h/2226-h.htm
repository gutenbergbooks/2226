<h2><a name="chap01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="poem">
O ye who tread the Narrow Way<br />
By Tophet-flare to Judgment Day,<br />
Be gentle when &ldquo;the heathen&rdquo; pray<br />
    To Buddha at Kamakura!
</p>

<p>
He sat, in defiance of municipal orders, astride the gun Zam Zammah on her
brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher&mdash;the Wonder House, as the
natives call the Lahore Museum. Who hold Zam-Zammah, that &ldquo;fire-breathing
dragon&rdquo;, hold the Punjab, for the great green-bronze piece is always
first of the conqueror&rsquo;s loot.
</p>

<p>
There was some justification for Kim&mdash;he had kicked Lala Dinanath&rsquo;s
boy off the trunnions&mdash;since the English held the Punjab and Kim was
English. Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the
vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain
sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys
of the bazar; Kim was white&mdash;a poor white of the very poorest. The
half-caste woman who looked after him (she smoked opium, and pretended to keep
a second-hand furniture shop by the square where the cheap cabs wait) told the
missionaries that she was Kim&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister; but his mother had
been nursemaid in a Colonel&rsquo;s family and had married Kimball
O&rsquo;Hara, a young colour-sergeant of the Mavericks, an Irish regiment. He
afterwards took a post on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, and his Regiment
went home without him. The wife died of cholera in Ferozepore, and O&rsquo;Hara
fell to drink and loafing up and down the line with the keen-eyed
three-year-old baby. Societies and chaplains, anxious for the child, tried to
catch him, but O&rsquo;Hara drifted away, till he came across the woman who
took opium and learned the taste from her, and died as poor whites die in
India. His estate at death consisted of three papers&mdash;one he called his
&ldquo;<i>ne varietur</i>&rdquo; because those words were written below his
signature thereon, and another his &ldquo;clearance-certificate&rdquo;. The
third was Kim&rsquo;s birth-certificate. Those things, he was used to say, in
his glorious opium-hours, would yet make little Kimball a man. On no account
was Kim to part with them, for they belonged to a great piece of
magic&mdash;such magic as men practised over yonder behind the Museum, in the
big blue-and-white Jadoo-Gher&mdash;the Magic House, as we name the Masonic
Lodge. It would, he said, all come right some day, and Kim&rsquo;s horn would
be exalted between pillars&mdash;monstrous pillars&mdash;of beauty and
strength. The Colonel himself, riding on a horse, at the head of the finest
Regiment in the world, would attend to Kim&mdash;little Kim that should have
been better off than his father. Nine hundred first-class devils, whose God was
a Red Bull on a green field, would attend to Kim, if they had not forgotten
O&rsquo;Hara&mdash;poor O&rsquo;Hara that was gang-foreman on the Ferozepore
line. Then he would weep bitterly in the broken rush chair on the veranda. So
it came about after his death that the woman sewed parchment, paper, and
birth-certificate into a leather amulet-case which she strung round Kim&rsquo;s
neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And some day,&rdquo; she said, confusedly remembering
O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s prophecies, &ldquo;there will come for you a great Red
Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes,
and&rdquo; dropping into English&mdash;&ldquo;nine hundred devils.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Kim, &ldquo;I shall remember. A Red Bull and a Colonel
on a horse will come, but first, my father said, will come the two men making
ready the ground for these matters. That is how my father said they always did;
and it is always so when men work magic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If the woman had sent Kim up to the local Jadoo-Gher with those papers, he
would, of course, have been taken over by the Provincial Lodge, and sent to the
Masonic Orphanage in the Hills; but what she had heard of magic she distrusted.
Kim, too, held views of his own. As he reached the years of indiscretion, he
learned to avoid missionaries and white men of serious aspect who asked who he
was, and what he did. For Kim did nothing with an immense success. True, he
knew the wonderful walled city of Lahore from the Delhi Gate to the outer Fort
Ditch; was hand in glove with men who led lives stranger than anything Haroun
al Raschid dreamed of; and he lived in a life wild as that of the Arabian
Nights, but missionaries and secretaries of charitable societies could not see
the beauty of it. His nickname through the wards was &ldquo;Little Friend of
all the World&rdquo;; and very often, being lithe and inconspicuous, he
executed commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny
young men of fashion. It was intrigue,&mdash;of course he knew that much, as he
had known all evil since he could speak,&mdash;but what he loved was the game
for its own sake&mdash;the stealthy prowl through the dark gullies and lanes,
the crawl up a waterpipe, the sights and sounds of the women&rsquo;s world on
the flat roofs, and the headlong flight from housetop to housetop under cover
of the hot dark. Then there were holy men, ash-smeared <i>faquirs</i> by their
brick shrines under the trees at the riverside, with whom he was quite
familiar&mdash;greeting them as they returned from begging-tours, and, when no
one was by, eating from the same dish. The woman who looked after him insisted
with tears that he should wear European clothes&mdash;trousers, a shirt and a
battered hat. Kim found it easier to slip into Hindu or Mohammedan garb when
engaged on certain businesses. One of the young men of fashion&mdash;he who was
found dead at the bottom of a well on the night of the earthquake&mdash;had
once given him a complete suit of Hindu kit, the costume of a lowcaste street
boy, and Kim stored it in a secret place under some baulks in Nila Ram&rsquo;s
timber-yard, beyond the Punjab High Court, where the fragrant deodar logs lie
seasoning after they have driven down the Ravi. When there was business or
frolic afoot, Kim would use his properties, returning at dawn to the veranda,
all tired out from shouting at the heels of a marriage procession, or yelling
at a Hindu festival. Sometimes there was food in the house, more often there
was not, and then Kim went out again to eat with his native friends.
</p>

<p>
As he drummed his heels against Zam-Zammah he turned now and again from his
king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the
sweetmeat-seller&rsquo;s son, to make a rude remark to the native policeman on
guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned
tolerantly: he knew Kim of old. So did the water-carrier, sluicing water on the
dry road from his goat-skin bag. So did Jawahir Singh, the Museum carpenter,
bent over new packing-cases. So did everybody in sight except the peasants from
the country, hurrying up to the Wonder House to view the things that men made
in their own province and elsewhere. The Museum was given up to Indian arts and
manufactures, and anybody who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Off! Off! Let me up!&rdquo; cried Abdullah, climbing up
Zam-Zammah&rsquo;s wheel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thy father was a pastry-cook, Thy mother stole the <i>ghi</i>,&rdquo;
sang Kim. &ldquo;All Mussalmans fell off Zam-Zammah long ago!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let <i>me</i> up!&rdquo; shrilled little Chota Lal in his
gilt-embroidered cap. His father was worth perhaps half a million sterling, but
India is the only democratic land in the world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Hindus fell off Zam-Zammah too. The Mussalmans pushed them off. Thy
father was a pastry-cook&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the roaring Motee Bazar,
such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all castes, had never seen. He was
nearly six feet high, dressed in fold upon fold of dingy stuff like
horse-blanketing, and not one fold of it could Kim refer to any known trade or
profession. At his belt hung a long open-work iron pencase and a wooden rosary
such as holy men wear. On his head was a gigantic sort of tam-o&rsquo;-shanter.
His face was yellow and wrinkled, like that of Fook Shing, the Chinese
bootmaker in the bazar. His eyes turned up at the corners and looked like
little slits of onyx.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; said Kim to his companions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps it is a man,&rdquo; said Abdullah, finger in mouth, staring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; returned Kim; &ldquo;but he is no man of India
that <i>I</i> have ever seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A priest, perhaps,&rdquo; said Chota Lal, spying the rosary. &ldquo;See!
He goes into the Wonder House!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said the policeman, shaking his head. &ldquo;I do not
understand your talk.&rdquo; The constable spoke Punjabi. &ldquo;O Friend of
all the World, what does he say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Send him hither,&rdquo; said Kim, dropping from Zam-Zammah, flourishing
his bare heels. &ldquo;He is a foreigner, and thou art a buffalo.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys. He was old, and his
woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking artemisia of the mountain
passes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Children, what is that big house?&rdquo; he said in very fair Urdu.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Ajaib-Gher, the Wonder House!&rdquo; Kim gave him no
title&mdash;such as Lala or Mian. He could not divine the man&rsquo;s creed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! The Wonder House! Can any enter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is written above the door&mdash;all can enter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Without payment?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I go in and out. <i>I</i> am no banker,&rdquo; laughed Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas! I am an old man. I did not know.&rdquo; Then, fingering his
rosary, he half turned to the Museum.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is your caste? Where is your house? Have you come far?&rdquo; Kim
asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I came by Kulu&mdash;from beyond the Kailas&mdash;but what know you?
From the Hills where&rdquo;&mdash;he sighed&mdash;&ldquo;the air and water are
fresh and cool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha! Khitai [a Chinaman],&rdquo; said Abdullah proudly. Fook Shing had
once chased him out of his shop for spitting at the joss above the boots.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pahari [a hillman],&rdquo; said little Chota Lal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aye, child&mdash;a hillman from hills thou&rsquo;lt never see. Didst
hear of Bhotiyal [Tibet]? I am no Khitai, but a Bhotiya [Tibetan], since you
must know&mdash;a lama&mdash;or, say, a <i>guru</i> in your tongue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A <i>guru</i> from Tibet,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;I have not seen such a
man. They be Hindus in Tibet, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We be followers of the Middle Way, living in peace in our lamasseries,
and I go to see the Four Holy Places before I die. Now do you, who are
children, know as much as I do who am old.&rdquo; He smiled benignantly on the
boys.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hast thou eaten?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He fumbled in his bosom and drew forth a worn, wooden begging-bowl. The boys
nodded. All priests of their acquaintance begged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not wish to eat yet.&rdquo; He turned his head like an old tortoise
in the sunlight. &ldquo;Is it true that there are many images in the Wonder
House of Lahore?&rdquo; He repeated the last words as one making sure of an
address.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Abdullah. &ldquo;It is full of heathen
<i>būts</i>. Thou also art an idolater.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind <i>him</i>,&rdquo; said. Kim. &ldquo;That is the
Government&rsquo;s house and there is no idolatry in it, but only a Sahib with
a white beard. Come with me and I will show.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Strange priests eat boys,&rdquo; whispered Chota Lal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he is a stranger and a <i>būt-parast</i> (idolater),&rdquo; said
Abdullah, the Mohammedan.
</p>

<p>
Kim laughed. &ldquo;He is new. Run to your mothers&rsquo; laps, and be safe.
Come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim clicked round the self-registering turnstile; the old man followed and
halted amazed. In the entrance-hall stood the larger figures of the
Greco-Buddhist sculptures done, savants know how long since, by forgotten
workmen whose hands were feeling, and not unskilfully, for the mysteriously
transmitted Grecian touch. There were hundreds of pieces, friezes of figures in
relief, fragments of statues and slabs crowded with figures that had encrusted
the brick walls of the Buddhist <i>stupas</i> and <i>viharas</i> of the North
Country and now, dug up and labelled, made the pride of the Museum. In
open-mouthed wonder the lama turned to this and that, and finally checked in
rapt attention before a large alto-relief representing a coronation or
apotheosis of the Lord Buddha. The Master was represented seated on a lotus the
petals of which were so deeply undercut as to show almost detached. Round Him
was an adoring hierarchy of kings, elders, and old-time Buddhas. Below were
lotus-covered waters with fishes and water-birds. Two butterfly-winged devas
held a wreath over His head; above them another pair supported an umbrella
surmounted by the jewelled headdress of the Bodhisat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Lord! The Lord! It is Sakya Muni himself,&rdquo; the lama half
sobbed; and under his breath began the wonderful Buddhist invocation:
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;To Him the Way,&mdash;the Law,&mdash;Apart&mdash;<br />
Whom Maya held beneath her heart,<br />
Ananda&rsquo;s Lord&mdash;the Bodhisat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;And He is here! The Most Excellent Law is here also. My pilgrimage is
well begun. And what work! What work!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yonder is the Sahib.&rdquo; said Kim, and dodged sideways among the
cases of the arts and manufacturers wing. A white-bearded Englishman was
looking at the lama, who gravely turned and saluted him and after some fumbling
drew forth a note-book and a scrap of paper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that is my name,&rdquo; smiling at the clumsy, childish print.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of us who had made pilgrimage to the Holy Places&mdash;he is now
Abbot of the Lung-Cho Monastery&mdash;gave it me,&rdquo; stammered the lama.
&ldquo;He spoke of these.&rdquo; His lean hand moved tremulously round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Welcome, then, O lama from Tibet. Here be the images, and I am
here&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced at the lama&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;to gather
knowledge. Come to my office awhile.&rdquo; The old man was trembling with
excitement.
</p>

<p>
The office was but a little wooden cubicle partitioned off from the
sculpture-lined gallery. Kim laid himself down, his ear against a crack in the
heat-split cedar door, and, following his instinct, stretched out to listen and
watch.
</p>

<p>
Most of the talk was altogether above his head. The lama, haltingly at first,
spoke to the Curator of his own lamassery, the Such-zen, opposite the Painted
Rocks, four months&rsquo; march away. The Curator brought out a huge book of
photos and showed him that very place, perched on its crag, overlooking the
gigantic valley of many-hued strata.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; The lama mounted a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles of
Chinese work. &ldquo;Here is the little door through which we bring wood before
winter. And thou&mdash;the English know of these things? He who is now Abbot of
Lung-Cho told me, but I did not believe. The Lord&mdash;the Excellent
One&mdash;He has honour here too? And His life is known?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is all carven upon the stones. Come and see, if thou art
rested.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Out shuffled the lama to the main hall, and, the Curator beside him, went
through the collection with the reverence of a devotee and the appreciative
instinct of a craftsman.
</p>

<p>
Incident by incident in the beautiful story he identified on the blurred stone,
puzzled here and there by the unfamiliar Greek convention, but delighted as a
child at each new trove. Where the sequence failed, as in the Annunciation, the
Curator supplied it from his mound of books&mdash;French and German, with
photographs and reproductions.
</p>

<p>
Here was the devout Asita, the pendant of Simeon in the Christian story,
holding the Holy Child on his knee while mother and father listened; and here
were incidents in the legend of the cousin Devadatta. Here was the wicked woman
who accused the Master of impurity, all confounded; here was the teaching in
the Deer-park; the miracle that stunned the fire-worshippers; here was the
Bodhisat in royal state as a prince; the miraculous birth; the death at
Kusinagara, where the weak disciple fainted; while there were almost countless
repetitions of the meditation under the Bodhi tree; and the adoration of the
alms-bowl was everywhere. In a few minutes the Curator saw that his guest was
no mere bead-telling mendicant, but a scholar of parts. And they went at it all
over again, the lama taking snuff, wiping his spectacles, and talking at
railway speed in a bewildering mixture of Urdu and Tibetan. He had heard of the
travels of the Chinese pilgrims, Fu-Hiouen and Hwen-Tsiang, and was anxious to
know if there was any translation of their record. He drew in his breath as he
turned helplessly over the pages of Beal and Stanislas Julien.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all here. A treasure locked.&rdquo; Then he composed himself
reverently to listen to fragments hastily rendered into Urdu. For the first
time he heard of the labours of European scholars, who by the help of these and
a hundred other documents have identified the Holy Places of Buddhism. Then he
was shown a mighty map, spotted and traced with yellow. The brown finger
followed the Curator&rsquo;s pencil from point to point. Here was Kapilavastu,
here the Middle Kingdom, and here Mahabodhi, the Mecca of Buddhism; and here
was Kusinagara, sad place of the Holy One&rsquo;s death. The old man bowed his
head over the sheets in silence for a while, and the Curator lit another pipe.
Kim had fallen asleep. When he waked, the talk, still in spate, was more within
his comprehension.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And thus it was, O Fountain of Wisdom, that I decided to go to the Holy
Places which His foot had trod&mdash;to the Birthplace, even to Kapila; then to
Mahabodhi, which is Buddh Gaya&mdash;to the Monastery&mdash;to the
Deer-park&mdash;to the place of His death.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama lowered his voice. &ldquo;And I come here alone. For
five&mdash;seven&mdash;eighteen&mdash;forty years it was in my mind that the
Old Law was not well followed; being overlaid, as thou knowest, with devildom,
charms, and idolatry. Even as the child outside said but now. Ay, even as the
child said, with <i>būt-parasti</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it comes with all faiths.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thinkest thou? The books of my lamassery I read, and they were dried
pith; and the later ritual with which we of the Reformed Law have cumbered
ourselves&mdash;that, too, had no worth to these old eyes. Even the followers
of the Excellent One are at feud on feud with one another. It is all illusion.
Ay, <i>maya</i>, illusion. But I have another desire&rdquo;&mdash;the seamed
yellow face drew within three inches of the Curator, and the long
forefinger-nail tapped on the table. &ldquo;Your scholars, by these books, have
followed the Blessed Feet in all their wanderings; but there are things which
they have not sought out. I know nothing&mdash;nothing do I know&mdash;but I go
to free myself from the Wheel of Things by a broad and open road.&rdquo; He
smiled with most simple triumph. &ldquo;As a pilgrim to the Holy Places I
acquire merit. But there is more. Listen to a true thing. When our gracious
Lord, being as yet a youth, sought a mate, men said, in His father&rsquo;s
Court, that He was too tender for marriage. Thou knowest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Curator nodded, wondering what would come next.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So they made the triple trial of strength against all comers. And at the
test of the Bow, our Lord first breaking that which they gave Him, called for
such a bow as none might bend. Thou knowest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is written. I have read.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, overshooting all other marks, the arrow passed far and far beyond
sight. At the last it fell; and, where it touched earth, there broke out a
stream which presently became a River, whose nature, by our Lord&rsquo;s
beneficence, and that merit He acquired ere He freed himself, is that whoso
bathes in it washes away all taint and speckle of sin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it is written,&rdquo; said the Curator sadly.
</p>

<p>
The lama drew a long breath. &ldquo;Where is that River? Fountain of Wisdom,
where fell the arrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas, my brother, I do not know,&rdquo; said the Curator.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, if it please thee to forget&mdash;the one thing only that thou hast
not told me. Surely thou must know? See, I am an old man! I ask with my head
between thy feet, O Fountain of Wisdom. We <i>know</i> He drew the bow! We
<i>know</i> the arrow fell! We know the stream gushed! Where, then, is the
River? My dream told me to find it. So I came. I am here. But where is the
River?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I knew, think you I would not cry it aloud?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By it one attains freedom from the Wheel of Things,&rdquo; the lama went
on, unheeding. &ldquo;The River of the Arrow! Think again! Some little stream,
maybe&mdash;dried in the heats? But the Holy One would never so cheat an old
man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know. I do not know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama brought his thousand-wrinkled face once more a handsbreadth from the
Englishman&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I see thou dost not know. Not being of the Law, the
matter is hid from thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay&mdash;hidden&mdash;hidden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are both bound, thou and I, my brother. But I&rdquo;&mdash;he rose
with a sweep of the soft thick drapery&mdash;&ldquo;I go to cut myself free.
Come also!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am bound,&rdquo; said the Curator. &ldquo;But whither goest
thou?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;First to Kashi [Benares]: where else? There I shall meet one of the pure
faith in a Jain temple of that city. He also is a Seeker in secret, and from
him haply I may learn. Maybe he will go with me to Buddh Gaya. Thence north and
west to Kapilavastu, and there will I seek for the River. Nay, I will seek
everywhere as I go&mdash;for the place is not known where the arrow
fell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how wilt thou go? It is a far cry to Delhi, and farther to
Benares.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By road and the trains. From Pathânkot, having left the Hills, I came
hither in a <i>te-rain</i>. It goes swiftly. At first I was amazed to see those
tall poles by the side of the road snatching up and snatching up their
threads,&rdquo;&mdash;he illustrated the stoop and whirl of a telegraph-pole
flashing past the train. &ldquo;But later, I was cramped and desired to walk,
as I am used.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And thou art sure of thy road?&rdquo; said the Curator.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, for that one but asks a question and pays money, and the appointed
persons despatch all to the appointed place. That much I knew in my lamassery
from sure report,&rdquo; said the lama proudly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And when dost thou go?&rdquo; The Curator smiled at the mixture of
old-world piety and modern progress that is the note of India today.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As soon as may be. I follow the places of His life till I come to the
River of the Arrow. There is, moreover, a written paper of the hours of the
trains that go south.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And for food?&rdquo; Lamas, as a rule, have good store of money
somewhere about them, but the Curator wished to make sure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the journey, I take up the Master&rsquo;s begging-bowl. Yes. Even as
He went so go I, forsaking the ease of my monastery. There was with me when I
left the hills a <i>chela</i> (disciple) who begged for me as the Rule demands,
but halting in Kulu awhile a fever took him and he died. I have now no
<i>chela</i>, but I will take the alms-bowl and thus enable the charitable to
acquire merit.&rdquo; He nodded his head valiantly. Learned doctors of a
lamassery do not beg, but the lama was an enthusiast in this quest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the Curator, smiling. &ldquo;Suffer me now to
acquire merit. We be craftsmen together, thou and I. Here is a new book of
white English paper: here be sharpened pencils two and three&mdash;thick and
thin, all good for a scribe. Now lend me thy spectacles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Curator looked through them. They were heavily scratched, but the power was
almost exactly that of his own pair, which he slid into the lama&rsquo;s hand,
saying: &ldquo;Try these.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A feather! A very feather upon the face.&rdquo; The old man turned his
head delightedly and wrinkled up his nose. &ldquo;How scarcely do I feel them!
How clearly do I see!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They be <i>bilaur</i>&mdash;crystal&mdash;and will never scratch. May
they help thee to thy River, for they are thine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will take them and the pencils and the white note-book,&rdquo; said
the lama, &ldquo;as a sign of friendship between priest and priest&mdash;and
now&mdash;&rdquo; He fumbled at his belt, detached the open-work iron pincers,
and laid it on the Curator&rsquo;s table. &ldquo;That is for a memory between
thee and me&mdash;my pencase. It is something old&mdash;even as I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a piece of ancient design, Chinese, of an iron that is not smelted these
days; and the collector&rsquo;s heart in the Curator&rsquo;s bosom had gone out
to it from the first. For no persuasion would the lama resume his gift.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I return, having found the River, I will bring thee a written
picture of the Padma Samthora such as I used to make on silk at the lamassery.
Yes&mdash;and of the Wheel of Life,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;for we be
craftsmen together, thou and I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Curator would have detained him: they are few in the world who still have
the secret of the conventional brush-pen Buddhist pictures which are, as it
were, half written and half drawn. But the lama strode out, head high in air,
and pausing an instant before the great statue of a Bodhisat in meditation,
brushed through the turnstiles.
</p>

<p>
Kim followed like a shadow. What he had overheard excited him wildly. This man
was entirely new to all his experience, and he meant to investigate further,
precisely as he would have investigated a new building or a strange festival in
Lahore city. The lama was his trove, and he purposed to take possession.
Kim&rsquo;s mother had been Irish, too.
</p>

<p>
The old man halted by Zam-Zammah and looked round till his eye fell on Kim. The
inspiration of his pilgrimage had left him for awhile, and he felt old,
forlorn, and very empty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not sit under that gun,&rdquo; said the policeman loftily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Huh! Owl!&rdquo; was Kim&rsquo;s retort on the lama&rsquo;s behalf.
&ldquo;Sit under that gun if it please thee. When didst thou steal the
milkwoman&rsquo;s slippers, Dunnoo?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was an utterly unfounded charge sprung on the spur of the moment, but it
silenced Dunnoo, who knew that Kim&rsquo;s clear yell could call up legions of
bad bazaar boys if need arose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And whom didst thou worship within?&rdquo; said Kim affably, squatting
in the shade beside the lama.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I worshipped none, child. I bowed before the Excellent Law.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim accepted this new God without emotion. He knew already a few score.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what dost thou do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg. I remember now it is long since I have eaten or drunk. What is
the custom of charity in this town? In silence, as we do of Tibet, or speaking
aloud?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those who beg in silence starve in silence,&rdquo; said Kim, quoting a
native proverb. The lama tried to rise, but sank back again, sighing for his
disciple, dead in far-away Kulu. Kim watched head to one side, considering and
interested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me the bowl. I know the people of this city&mdash;all who are
charitable. Give, and I will bring it back filled.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Simply as a child the old man handed him the bowl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rest, thou. <i>I</i> know the people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He trotted off to the open shop of a <i>kunjri</i>, a low-caste
vegetable-seller, which lay opposite the belt-tramway line down the Motee
Bazar. She knew Kim of old.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho, hast thou turned <i>yogi</i> with thy begging-bowl?&rdquo; she
cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay.&rdquo; said Kim proudly. &ldquo;There is a new priest in the
city&mdash;a man such as I have never seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Old priest&mdash;young tiger,&rdquo; said the woman angrily. &ldquo;I am
tired of new priests! They settle on our wares like flies. Is the father of my
son a well of charity to give to all who ask?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;Thy man is rather <i>yagi</i> (bad-tempered)
than <i>yogi</i> (a holy man). But this priest is new. The Sahib in the Wonder
House has talked to him like a brother. O my mother, fill me this bowl. He
waits.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That bowl indeed! That cow-bellied basket! Thou hast as much grace as
the holy bull of Shiv. He has taken the best of a basket of onions already,
this morn; and forsooth, I must fill thy bowl. He comes here again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The huge, mouse-coloured Brahmini bull of the ward was shouldering his way
through the many-coloured crowd, a stolen plantain hanging out of his mouth. He
headed straight for the shop, well knowing his privileges as a sacred beast,
lowered his head, and puffed heavily along the line of baskets ere making his
choice. Up flew Kim&rsquo;s hard little heel and caught him on his moist blue
nose. He snorted indignantly, and walked away across the tram-rails, his hump
quivering with rage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See! I have saved more than the bowl will cost thrice over. Now, mother,
a little rice and some dried fish atop&mdash;yes, and some vegetable
curry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A growl came out of the back of the shop, where a man lay.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He drove away the bull,&rdquo; said the woman in an undertone. &ldquo;It
is good to give to the poor.&rdquo; She took the bowl and returned it full of
hot rice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But my <i>yogi</i> is not a cow,&rdquo; said Kim gravely, making a hole
with his fingers in the top of the mound. &ldquo;A little curry is good, and a
fried cake, and a morsel of conserve would please him, I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a hole as big as thy head,&rdquo; said the woman fretfully. But
she filled it, none the less, with good, steaming vegetable curry, clapped a
fried cake atop, and a morsel of clarified butter on the cake, dabbed a lump of
sour tamarind conserve at the side; and Kim looked at the load lovingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is good. When I am in the bazar the bull shall not come to this
house. He is a bold beggar-man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And thou?&rdquo; laughed the woman. &ldquo;But speak well of bulls. Hast
thou not told me that some day a Red Bull will come out of a field to help
thee? Now hold all straight and ask for the holy man&rsquo;s blessing upon me.
Perhaps, too, he knows a cure for my daughter&rsquo;s sore eyes. Ask. him that
also, O thou Little Friend of all the World.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Kim had danced off ere the end of the sentence, dodging pariah dogs and
hungry acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thus do we beg who know the way of it,&rdquo; said he proudly to the
lama, who opened his eyes at the contents of the bowl. &ldquo;Eat now
and&mdash;I will eat with thee. Ohé <i>bhistie!</i>&rdquo; he called to the
water-carrier, sluicing the crotons by the Museum. &ldquo;Give water here. We
men are thirsty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We men!&rdquo; said the <i>bhistie</i>, laughing. &ldquo;Is one skinful
enough for such a pair? Drink, then, in the name of the Compassionate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He loosed a thin stream into Kim&rsquo;s hands, who drank native fashion; but
the lama must needs pull out a cup from his inexhaustible upper draperies and
drink ceremonially.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Pardesi</i> (a foreigner),&rdquo; Kim explained, as the old man
delivered in an unknown tongue what was evidently a blessing.
</p>

<p>
They ate together in great content, clearing the beggingbowl. Then the lama
took snuff from a portentous wooden snuff-gourd, fingered his rosary awhile,
and so dropped into the easy sleep of age, as the shadow of Zam-Zammah grew
long.
</p>

<p>
Kim loafed over to the nearest tobacco-seller, a rather lively young Mohammedan
woman, and begged a rank cigar of the brand that they sell to students of the
Punjab University who copy English customs. Then he smoked and thought, knees
to chin, under the belly of the gun, and the outcome of his thoughts was a
sudden and stealthy departure in the direction of Nila Ram&rsquo;s timber-yard.
</p>

<p>
The lama did not wake till the evening life of the city had begun with
lamp-lighting and the return of white-robed clerks and subordinates from the
Government offices. He stared dizzily in all directions, but none looked at him
save a Hindu urchin in a dirty turban and Isabella-coloured clothes. Suddenly
he bowed his head on his knees and wailed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said the boy, standing before him. &ldquo;Hast thou
been robbed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is my new <i>chela</i> (disciple) that is gone away from me, and I
know not where he is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what like of man was thy disciple?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a boy who came to me in place of him who died, on account of the
merit which I had gained when I bowed before the Law within there.&rdquo; He
pointed towards the Museum. &ldquo;He came upon me to show me a road which I
had lost. He led me into the Wonder House, and by his talk emboldened me to
speak to the Keeper of the Images, so that I was cheered and made strong. And
when I was faint with hunger he begged for me, as would a <i>chela</i> for his
teacher. Suddenly was he sent. Suddenly has he gone away. It was in my mind to
have taught him the Law upon the road to Benares.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim stood amazed at this, because he had overheard the talk in the Museum, and
knew that the old man was speaking the truth, which is a thing a native on the
road seldom presents to a stranger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I see now that he was but sent for a purpose. By this I know that I
shall find a certain River for which I seek.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The River of the Arrow?&rdquo; said Kim, with a superior smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this yet another Sending?&rdquo; cried the lama. &ldquo;To none have
I spoken of my search, save to the Priest of the Images. Who art thou?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thy <i>chela</i>,&rdquo; said Kim simply, sitting on his heels. &ldquo;I
have never seen anyone like to thee in all this my life. I go with thee to
Benares. And, too, I think that so old a man as thou, speaking the truth to
chance-met people at dusk, is in great need of a disciple.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the River&mdash;the River of the Arrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that I heard when thou wast speaking to the Englishman. I lay
against the door.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama sighed. &ldquo;I thought thou hadst been a guide permitted. Such
things fall sometimes&mdash;but I am not worthy. Thou dost not, then, know the
River?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; Kim laughed uneasily. &ldquo;I go to look for&mdash;for a
bull&mdash;a Red. Bull on a green field who shall help me.&rdquo; Boylike, if
an acquaintance had a scheme, Kim was quite ready with one of his own; and,
boylike, he had really thought for as much as twenty minutes at a time of his
father&rsquo;s prophecy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To what, child?&rdquo; said the lama.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God knows, but so my father told me&rdquo;. I heard thy talk in the
Wonder House of all those new strange places in the Hills, and if one so old
and so little&mdash;so used to truth-telling&mdash;may go out for the small
matter of a river, it seemed to me that I too must go a-travelling. If it is
our fate to find those things we shall find them&mdash;thou, thy River; and I,
my Bull, and the Strong Pillars and some other matters that I forget.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not pillars but a Wheel from which I would be free,&rdquo; said
the lama.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is all one. Perhaps they will make me a king,&rdquo; said Kim,
serenely prepared for anything.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will teach thee other and better desires upon the road,&rdquo; the
lama replied in the voice of authority. &ldquo;Let us go to Benares.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not by night. Thieves are abroad. Wait till the day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there is no place to sleep.&rdquo; The old man was used to the order
of his monastery, and though he slept on the ground, as the Rule decrees,
preferred a decency in these things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall get good lodging at the Kashmir Serai,&rdquo; said Kim,
laughing at his perplexity. &ldquo;I have a friend there. Come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The hot and crowded bazars blazed with light as they made their way through the
press of all the races in Upper India, and the lama mooned through it like a
man in a dream. It was his first experience of a large manufacturing city, and
the crowded tram-car with its continually squealing brakes frightened him. Half
pushed, half towed, he arrived at the high gate of the Kashmir Serai: that huge
open square over against the railway station, surrounded with arched cloisters,
where the camel and horse caravans put up on their return from Central Asia.
Here were all manner of Northern folk, tending tethered ponies and kneeling
camels; loading and unloading bales and bundles; drawing water for the evening
meal at the creaking well-windlasses; piling grass before the shrieking,
wild-eyed stallions; cuffing the surly caravan dogs; paying off camel-drivers;
taking on new grooms; swearing, shouting, arguing, and chaffering in the packed
square. The cloisters, reached by three or four masonry steps, made a haven of
refuge around this turbulent sea. Most of them were rented to traders, as we
rent the arches of a viaduct; the space between pillar and pillar being bricked
or boarded off into rooms, which were guarded by heavy wooden doors and
cumbrous native padlocks. Locked doors showed that the owner was away, and a
few rude&mdash;sometimes very rude&mdash;chalk or paint scratches told where he
had gone. Thus: &ldquo;Lutuf Ullah is gone to Kurdistan.&rdquo; Below, in
coarse verse: &ldquo;O Allah, who sufferest lice to live on the coat of a
Kabuli, why hast thou allowed this louse Lutuf to live so long?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim, fending the lama between excited men and excited beasts, sidled along the
cloisters to the far end, nearest therailway station, where Mahbub Ali, the
horse-trader, lived when he came in from that mysterious land beyond the Passes
of the North.
</p>

<p>
Kim had had many dealings with Mahbub in his little life, especially between
his tenth and his thirteenth year&mdash;and the big burly Afghan, his beard
dyed scarlet with lime (for he was elderly and did not wish his grey hairs to
show), knew the boy&rsquo;s value as a gossip. Sometimes he would tell Kim to
watch a man who had nothing whatever to do with horses: to follow him for one
whole day and report every soul with whom he talked. Kim would deliver himself
of his tale at evening, and Mahbub would listen without a word or gesture. It
was intrigue of some kind, Kim knew; but its worth lay in saying nothing
whatever to anyone except Mahbub, who gave him beautiful meals all hot from the
cookshop at the head of the serai, and once as much as eight annas in money.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is here,&rdquo; said Kim, hitting a bad-tempered camel on the nose.
&ldquo;Ohé, Mahbub Ali!&rdquo; He halted at a dark arch and slipped behind the
bewildered lama.
</p>

<p>
The horse-trader, his deep, embroidered Bokhariot belt unloosed, was lying on a
pair of silk carpet saddle-bags, pulling lazily at an immense silver hookah. He
turned his head very slightly at the cry; and seeing only the tall silent
figure, chuckled in his deep chest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah! A lama! A Red Lama! It is far from Lahore to the Passes. What
dost thou do here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama held out the begging-bowl mechanically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s curse on all unbelievers!&rdquo; said Mahbub. &ldquo;I do
not give to a lousy Tibetan; but ask my Baltis over yonder behind the camels.
They may value your blessings. Oh, horseboys, here is a countryman of yours.
See if he be hungry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A shaven, crouching Balti, who had come down with the horses, and who was
nominally some sort of degraded Buddhist, fawned upon the priest, and in thick
gutturals besought the Holy One to sit at the horseboys&rsquo; fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said Kim, pushing him lightly, and the lama strode away,
leaving Kim at the edge of the cloister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said Mahbub Ali, returning to his hookah. &ldquo;Little
Hindu, run away. God&rsquo;s curse on all unbelievers! Beg from those of my
tail who are of thy faith.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maharaj,&rdquo; whined Kim, using the Hindu form of address, and
thoroughly enjoying the situation; &ldquo;my father is dead&mdash;my mother is
dead&mdash;my stomach is empty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beg from my men among the horses, I say. There must be some Hindus in my
tail.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mahbub Ali, but am <i>I</i> a Hindu?&rdquo; said Kim in English.
</p>

<p>
The trader gave no sign of astonishment, but looked under shaggy eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Little Friend of all the World,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is
this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing. I am now that holy man&rsquo;s disciple; and we go a pilgrimage
together&mdash;to Benares, he says. He is quite mad, and I am tired of Lahore
city. I wish new air and water.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But for whom dost thou work? Why come to me?&rdquo; The voice was harsh
with suspicion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To whom else should I come? I have no money. It is not good to go about
without money. Thou wilt sell many horses to the officers. They are very fine
horses, these new ones: I have seen them. Give me a rupee, Mahbub Ali, and when
I come to my wealth I will give thee a bond and pay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Mahbub Ali, thinking swiftly. &ldquo;Thou hast never
before lied to me. Call that lama&mdash;stand back in the dark.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, our tales will agree,&rdquo; said Kim, laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We go to Benares,&rdquo; said the lama, as soon as he understood the
drift of Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s questions. &ldquo;The boy and I, I go to seek for a
certain River.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;but the boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is my disciple. He was sent, I think, to guide me to that River.
Sitting under a gun was I when he came suddenly. Such things have befallen the
fortunate to whom guidance was allowed. But I remember now, he said he was of
this world&mdash;a Hindu.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And his name?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I did not ask. Is he not my disciple?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His country&mdash;his race&mdash;his village? Mussalman&mdash;Sikh
Hindu&mdash;Jain&mdash;low caste or high?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I ask? There is neither high nor low in the Middle Way. If he
is my <i>chela</i>&mdash;does&mdash;will&mdash;can anyone take him from me?
for, look you, without him I shall not find my River.&rdquo; He wagged his head
solemnly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None shall take him from thee. Go, sit among my Baltis,&rdquo; said
Mahbub Ali, and the lama drifted off, soothed by the promise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he not quite mad?&rdquo; said Kim, coming forward to the light again.
&ldquo;Why should I lie to thee, Hajji?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mahbub puffed his hookah in silence. Then he began, almost whispering:
&ldquo;Umballa is on the road to Benares&mdash;if indeed ye two go
there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tck! Tck! I tell thee he does not know how to lie&mdash;as we two
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if thou wilt carry a message for me as far as Umballa, I will give
thee money. It concerns a horse&mdash;a white stallion which I have sold to an
officer upon the last time I returned from the Passes. But then&mdash;stand
nearer and hold up hands as begging&mdash;the pedigree of the white stallion
was not fully established, and that officer, who is now at Umballa, bade me
make it clear.&rdquo; (Mahbub here described the horse and the appearance of
the officer.) &ldquo;So the message to that officer will be: &lsquo;The
pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.&rsquo; By this will he
know that thou comest from me. He will then say &lsquo;What proof hast
thou?&rsquo; and thou wilt answer: &lsquo;Mahbub Ali has given me the
proof.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And all for the sake of a white stallion,&rdquo; said Kim, with a
giggle, his eyes aflame.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That pedigree I will give thee now&mdash;in my own fashion and some hard
words as well.&rdquo; A shadow passed behind Kim, and a feeding camel. Mahbub
Ali raised his voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah! Art thou the only beggar in the city? Thy mother is dead. Thy
father is dead. So is it with all of them. Well, well&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned as feeling on the floor beside him and tossed a flap of soft, greasy
Mussalman bread to the boy. &ldquo;Go and lie down among my horseboys for
tonight&mdash;thou and the lama. Tomorrow I may give thee service.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim slunk away, his teeth in the bread, and, as he expected, he found a small
wad of folded tissue-paper wrapped in oilskin, with three silver
rupees&mdash;enormous largesse. He smiled and thrust money and paper into his
leather amulet-case. The lama, sumptuously fed by Mahbub&rsquo;s Baltis, was
already asleep in a corner of one of the stalls. Kim lay down beside him and
laughed. He knew he had rendered a service to Mahbub Ali, and not for one
little minute did he believe the tale of the stallion&rsquo;s pedigree.
</p>

<p>
But Kim did not suspect that Mahbub Ali, known as one of the best horse-dealers
in the Punjab, a wealthy and enterprising trader, whose caravans penetrated far
and far into the Back of Beyond, was registered in one of the locked books of
the Indian Survey Department as C25 IB. Twice or thrice yearly C25 would send
in a little story, baldly told but most interesting, and generally&mdash;it was
checked by the statements of R17 and M4&mdash;quite true. It concerned all
manner of out-of-the-way mountain principalities, explorers of nationalities
other than English, and the guntrade&mdash;was, in brief, a small portion of
that vast mass of &ldquo;information received&rdquo; on which the Indian
Government acts. But, recently, five confederated Kings, who had no business to
confederate, had been informed by a kindly Northern Power that there was a
leakage of news from their territories into British India. So those
Kings&rsquo; Prime Ministers were seriously annoyed and took steps, after the
Oriental fashion. They suspected, among many others, the bullying, red-bearded
horsedealer whose caravans ploughed through their fastnesses belly-deep in
snow. At least, his caravan that season had been ambushed and shot at twice on
the way down, when Mahbub&rsquo;s men accounted for three strange ruffians who
might, or might not, have been hired for the job. Therefore Mahbub had avoided
halting at the insalubrious city of Peshawur, and had come through without stop
to Lahore, where, knowing his country-people, he anticipated curious
developments.
</p>

<p>
And there was that on Mahbub Ali which he did not wish to keep an hour longer
than was necessary&mdash;a wad of closely folded tissue-paper, wrapped in
oilskin&mdash;an impersonal, unaddressed statement, with five microscopic
pin-holes in one corner, that most scandalously betrayed the five confederated
Kings, the sympathetic Northern Power, a Hindu banker in Peshawur, a firm of
gun-makers in Belgium, and an important, semi-independent Mohammedan ruler to
the south. This last was R17&rsquo;s work, which Mahbub had picked up beyond
the Dora Pass and was carrying in for R17, who, owing to circumstances over
which he had no control, could not leave his post of observation. Dynamite was
milky and innocuous beside that report of C25; and even an Oriental, with an
Oriental&rsquo;s views of the value of time, could see that the sooner it was
in the proper hands the better. Mahbub had no particular desire to die by
violence, because two or three family blood-feuds across the Border hung
unfinished on his hands, and when these scores were cleared he intended to
settle down as a more or less virtuous citizen. He had never passed the serai
gate since his arrival two days ago, but had been ostentatious in sending
telegrams to Bombay, where he banked some of his money; to Delhi, where a
sub-partner of his own clan was selling horses to the agent of a Rajputana
state; and to Umballa, where an Englishman was excitedly demanding the pedigree
of a white stallion. The public letter-writer, who knew English, composed
excellent telegrams, such as: &ldquo;<i>Creighton, Laurel Bank, Umballa. Horse
is Arabian as already advised. Sorrowful delayed pedigree which am
translating.</i>&rdquo; And later to the same address: &ldquo;<i>Much sorrowful
delay. Will forward pedigree.</i>&rdquo; To his sub-partner at Delhi he wired:
&ldquo;<i>Lutuf Ullah. Have wired two thousand rupees your credit Luchman
Narain&rsquo;s bank.</i>&mdash;&rdquo; This was entirely in the way of trade,
but every one of those telegrams was discussed and rediscussed, by parties who
conceived themselves to be interested, before they went over to the railway
station in charge of a foolish Balti, who allowed all sorts of people to read
them on the road.
</p>

<p>
When, in Mahbub&rsquo;s own picturesque language, he had muddied the wells of
inquiry with the stick of precaution, Kim had dropped on him, sent from Heaven;
and, being as prompt as he was unscrupulous, Mahbub Ali used to taking all
sorts of gusty chances, pressed him into service on the spot.
</p>

<p>
A wandering lama with a low-caste boy-servant might attract a moment&rsquo;s
interest as they wandered about India, the land of pilgrims; but no one would
suspect them or, what was more to the point, rob.
</p>

<p>
He called for a new light-ball to his hookah, and considered the case. If the
worst came to the worst, and the boy came to harm, the paper would incriminate
nobody. And he would go up to Umballa leisurely and&mdash;at a certain risk of
exciting fresh suspicion&mdash;repeat his tale by word of mouth to the people
concerned.
</p>

<p>
But R17&rsquo;s report was the kernel of the whole affair, and it would be
distinctly inconvenient if that failed to come to hand. However, God was great,
and Mahbub Ali felt he had done all he could for the time being. Kim was the
one soul in the world who had never told him a lie. That would have been a
fatal blot on Kim&rsquo;s character if Mahbub had not known that to others, for
his own ends or Mahbub&rsquo;s business, Kim could lie like an Oriental.
</p>

<p>
Then Mahbub Ali rolled across the serai to the Gate of the Harpies who paint
their eyes and trap the stranger, and was at some pains to call on the one girl
who, he had reason to believe, was a particular friend of a smooth-faced
Kashmiri pundit who had waylaid his simple Balti in the matter of the
telegrams. It was an utterly foolish thing to do; because they fell to drinking
perfumed brandy against the Law of the Prophet, and Mahbub grew wonderfully
drunk, and the gates of his mouth were loosened, and he pursued the Flower of
Delight with the feet of intoxication till he fell flat among the cushions,
where the Flower of Delight, aided by a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit, searched
him from head to foot most thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
About the same hour Kim heard soft feet in Mahbub&rsquo;s deserted stall. The
horse-trader, curiously enough, had left his door unlocked, and his men were
busy celebrating their return to India with a whole sheep of Mahbub&rsquo;s
bounty. A sleek young gentleman from Delhi, armed with a bunch of keys which
the Flower had unshackled from the senseless one&rsquo;s belt, went through
every single box, bundle, mat, and saddle-bag in Mahbub&rsquo;s possession even
more systematically than the Flower and the pundit were searching the owner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I think.&rdquo; said the Flower scornfully an hour later, one
rounded elbow on the snoring carcass, &ldquo;that he is no more than a pig of
an Afghan horse-dealer, with no thought except women and horses. Moreover, he
may have sent it away by now&mdash;if ever there were such a thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay&mdash;in a matter touching Five Kings it would be next his black
heart,&rdquo; said the pundit. &ldquo;Was there nothing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Delhi man laughed and resettled his turban as he entered. &ldquo;I searched
between the soles of his slippers as the Flower searched his clothes. This is
not the man but another. I leave little unseen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They did not say he was the very man,&rdquo; said the pundit
thoughtfully. &ldquo;They said, &lsquo;Look if he be the man, since our
counsels are troubled.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That North country is full of horse-dealers as an old coat of lice.
There is Sikandar Khan, Nur Ali Beg, and Farrukh Shah all heads of kafilas
[caravans]&mdash;who deal there,&rdquo; said the Flower.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They have not yet come in,&rdquo; said the pundit. &ldquo;Thou must
ensnare them later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Phew!&rdquo; said the Flower with deep disgust, rolling Mahbub&rsquo;s head
from her lap. &ldquo;I earn my money. Farrukh Shah is a bear, Ali Beg a
swashbuckler, and old Sikandar Khan&mdash;yaie! Go! I sleep now. This swine
will not stir till dawn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Mahbub woke, the Flower talked to him severely on the sin of drunkenness.
Asiatics do not wink when they have outmanoeuvred an enemy, but as Mahbub Ali
cleared his throat, tightened his belt, and staggered forth under the early
morning stars, he came very near to it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a colt&rsquo;s trick!&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;As if every
girl in Peshawur did not use it! But &rsquo;twas prettily done. Now God He
knows how many more there be upon the Road who have orders to test
me&mdash;perhaps with the knife. So it stands that the boy must go to
Umballa&mdash;and by rail&mdash;for the writing is something urgent. I abide
here, following the Flower and drinking wine as an Afghan coper should.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He halted at the stall next but one to his own. His men lay there heavy with
sleep. There was no sign of Kim or the lama.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Up!&rdquo; He stirred a sleeper. &ldquo;Whither went those who lay here
last even&mdash;the lama and the boy? Is aught missing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; grunted the man, &ldquo;the old madman rose at second
cockcrow saying he would go to Benares, and the young one led him away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The curse of Allah on all unbelievers!&rdquo; said Mahbub heartily, and
climbed into his own stall, growling in his beard.
</p>

<p>
But it was Kim who had wakened the lama&mdash;Kim with one eye laid against a
knot-hole in the planking, who had seen the Delhi man&rsquo;s search through
the boxes. This was no common thief that turned over letters, bills, and
saddles&mdash;no mere burglar who ran a little knife sideways into the soles of
Mahbub&rsquo;s slippers, or picked the seams of the saddle-bags so deftly. At
first Kim had been minded to give the alarm&mdash;the long-drawn
<i>cho-or&mdash;choor!</i> (thief! thief!) that sets the serai ablaze of
nights; but he looked more carefully, and, hand on amulet, drew his own
conclusions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must be the pedigree of that made-up horse-lie,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the thing that I carry to Umballa. Better that we go now. Those who
search bags with knives may presently search bellies with knives. Surely there
is a woman behind this. Hai! Hai! in a whisper to the light-sleeping old man.
&ldquo;Come. It is time&mdash;time to go to Benares.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama rose obediently, and they passed out of the serai like shadows.

</p>

<p>
They entered the fort-like railway station, black in the end of night; the
electrics sizzling over the goods-yard where they handle the heavy Northern
grain-traffic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the work of devils!&rdquo; said the lama, recoiling from the
hollow echoing darkness, the glimmer of rails between the masonry platforms,
and the maze of girders above. He stood in a gigantic stone hall paved, it
seemed, with the sheeted dead third-class passengers who had taken their
tickets overnight and were sleeping in the waiting-rooms. All hours of the
twenty-four are alike to Orientals, and their passenger traffic is regulated
accordingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is where the fire-carriages come. One stands behind that
hole&rdquo;&mdash;Kim pointed to the ticket-office&mdash;&ldquo;who will give
thee a paper to take thee to Umballa.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But we go to Benares,&rdquo; he replied petulantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All one. Benares then. Quick: she comes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take thou the purse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama, not so well used to trains as he had pretended, started as the 3.25
a.m. south-bound roared in. The sleepers sprang to life, and the station filled
with clamour and shoutings, cries of water and sweetmeat vendors, shouts of
native policemen, and shrill yells of women gathering up their baskets, their
families, and their husbands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is the train&mdash;only the <i>te-rain</i>. It will not come here.
Wait!&rdquo; Amazed at the lama&rsquo;s immense simplicity (he had handed him a
small bag full of rupees), Kim asked and paid for a ticket to Umballa. A sleepy
clerk grunted and flung out a ticket to the next station, just six miles
distant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Kim, scanning it with a grin. &ldquo;This may serve for
farmers, but I live in the city of Lahore. It was cleverly done, Babu. Now give
the ticket to Umballa.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Babu scowled and dealt the proper ticket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now another to Amritzar,&rdquo; said Kim, who had no notion of spending
Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s money on anything so crude as a paid ride to Umballa.
&ldquo;The price is so much. The small money in return is just so much. I know
the ways of the <i>te-rain</i> ... Never did <i>yogi</i> need <i>chela</i> as
thou dost,&rdquo; he went on merrily to the bewildered lama. &ldquo;They would
have flung thee out at Mian Mir but for me. This way! Come!&rdquo; He returned
the money, keeping only one anna in each rupee of the price of the Umballa
ticket as his commission&mdash;the immemorial commission of Asia.
</p>

<p>
The lama jibbed at the open door of a crowded third-class carriage. &ldquo;Were
it not better to walk?&rdquo; said he weakly.
</p>

<p>
A burly Sikh artisan thrust forth his bearded head. &ldquo;Is he afraid? Do not
be afraid. I remember the time when I was afraid of the train. Enter! This
thing is the work of the Government.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not fear,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;Have ye room within for
two?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no room even for a mouse,&rdquo; shrilled the wife of a
well-to-do cultivator&mdash;a Hindu Jat from the rich Jullundur, district. Our
night trains are not as well looked after as the day ones, where the sexes are
very strictly kept to separate carriages.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, mother of my son, we can make space,&rdquo; said the blueturbaned
husband. &ldquo;Pick up the child. It is a holy man, see&rsquo;st thou?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And my lap full of seventy times seven bundles! Why not bid him sit on
my knee, Shameless? But men are ever thus!&rdquo; She looked round for
approval. An Amritzar courtesan near the window sniffed behind her head
drapery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enter! Enter!&rdquo; cried a fat Hindu money-lender, his folded
account-book in a cloth under his arm. With an oily smirk: &ldquo;It is well to
be kind to the poor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, at seven per cent a month with a mortgage on the unborn calf,&rdquo;
said a young Dogra soldier going south on leave; and they all laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will it travel to Benares?&rdquo; said the lama.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Assuredly. Else why should we come? Enter, or we are left,&rdquo; cried
Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See!&rdquo; shrilled the Amritzar girl. &ldquo;He has never entered a
train. Oh, see!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, help,&rdquo; said the cultivator, putting out a large brown hand
and hauling him in. &ldquo;Thus is it done, father.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;I sit on the floor. It is against the Rule to sit on
a bench,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;Moreover, it cramps me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; began the money-lender, pursing his lips, &ldquo;that
there is not one rule of right living which these <i>te-rains</i> do not cause
us to break. We sit, for example, side by side with all castes and
peoples.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yea, and with most outrageously shameless ones,&rdquo; said the wife,
scowling at the Amritzar girl making eyes at the young sepoy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said we might have gone by cart along the road,&rdquo; said the
husband, &ldquo;and thus have saved some money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and spent twice over what we saved on food by the way. That
was talked out ten thousand times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, by ten thousand tongues,&rdquo; grunted he.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Gods help us poor women if we may not speak. Oho! He is of that sort
which may not look at or reply to a woman.&rdquo; For the lama, constrained by
his Rule, took not the faintest notice of her. &ldquo;And his disciple is like
him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, mother,&rdquo; said Kim most promptly. &ldquo;Not when the woman is
well-looking and above all charitable to the hungry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A beggar&rsquo;s answer,&rdquo; said the Sikh, laughing. &ldquo;Thou
hast brought it on thyself, sister!&rdquo; Kim&rsquo;s hands were crooked in
supplication.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And whither goest thou?&rdquo; said the woman, handing him the half of a
cake from a greasy package.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even to Benares.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jugglers belike?&rdquo; the young soldier suggested. &ldquo;Have ye any
tricks to pass the time? Why does not that yellow man answer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Kim stoutly, &ldquo;he is holy, and thinks upon
matters hidden from thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That may be well. We of the Ludhiana Sikhs&rdquo;&mdash;he rolled it out
sonorously&mdash;&ldquo;do not trouble our heads with doctrine. We
fight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s son is <i>naik</i> (corporal) in that
regiment,&rdquo; said the Sikh craftsman quietly. &ldquo;There are also some
Dogra companies there.&rdquo; The soldier glared, for a Dogra is of other caste
than a Sikh, and the banker tittered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are all one to me,&rdquo; said the Amritzar girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That we believe,&rdquo; snorted the cultivator&rsquo;s wife malignantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, but all who serve the Sirkar with weapons in their hands are, as it
were, one brotherhood. There is one brotherhood of the caste, but beyond that
again&rdquo;&mdash;she looked round timidly&mdash;&ldquo;the bond of the
<i>Pulton</i>&mdash;the Regiment&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My brother is in a Jat regiment,&rdquo; said the cultivator.
&ldquo;Dogras be good men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thy Sikhs at least were of that opinion,&rdquo; said the soldier, with a
scowl at the placid old man in the corner. &ldquo;<i>Thy</i> Sikhs thought so
when our two companies came to help them at the Pirzai Kotal in the face of
eight Afridi standards on the ridge not three months gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He told the story of a Border action in which the Dogra companies of the
Ludhiana Sikhs had acquitted themselves well. The Amritzar girl smiled; for she
knew the talk was to win her approval.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the cultivator&rsquo;s wife at the end. &ldquo;So
their villages were burnt and their little children made homeless?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They had marked our dead. They paid a great payment after we of the
Sikhs had schooled them. So it was. Is this Amritzar?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, and here they cut our tickets,&rdquo; said the banker, fumbling at
his belt.
</p>

<p>
The lamps were paling in the dawn when the half-caste guard came round.
Ticket-collecting is a slow business in the East, where people secrete their
tickets in all sorts of curious places. Kim produced his and was told to get
out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I go to Umballa,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I go with this holy
man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou canst go to Jehannum for aught I care. This ticket is
only&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim burst into a flood of tears, protesting that the lama was his father and
his mother, that he was the prop of the lama&rsquo;s declining years, and that
the lama would die without his care. All the carriage bade the guard be
merciful&mdash;the banker was specially eloquent here&mdash;but the guard
hauled Kim on to the platform. The lama blinked&mdash;he could not overtake the
situation and Kim lifted up his voice and wept outside the carriage window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very poor. My father is dead&mdash;my mother is dead. O charitable
ones, if I am left here, who shall tend that old man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&mdash;what is this?&rdquo; the lama repeated. &ldquo;He must go to
Benares. He must come with me. He is my <i>chela</i>. If there is money to be
paid&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, be silent,&rdquo; whispered Kim; &ldquo;are we Rajahs to throw away
good silver when the world is so charitable?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Amritzar girl stepped out with her bundles, and it was on her that Kim kept
his watchful eye. Ladies of that persuasion, he knew, were generous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A ticket&mdash;a little <i>tikkut</i> to Umballa&mdash;O Breaker of
Hearts!&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Hast thou no charity?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does the holy man come from the North?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From far and far in the North he comes,&rdquo; cried Kim. &ldquo;From
among the hills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is snow among the pine-trees in the North&mdash;in the hills there
is snow. My mother was from Kulu. Get thee a ticket. Ask him for a
blessing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ten thousand blessings,&rdquo; shrilled Kim. &ldquo;O Holy One, a woman
has given us in charity so that I can come with thee&mdash;a woman with a
golden heart. I run for the <i>tikkut</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl looked up at the lama, who had mechanically followed Kim to the
platform. He bowed his head that he might not see her, and muttered in Tibetan
as she passed on with the crowd.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Light come&mdash;light go,&rdquo; said the cultivator&rsquo;s wife
viciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has acquired merit,&rdquo; returned the lama. &ldquo;Beyond doubt it
was a nun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There be ten thousand such nuns in Amritzar alone. Return, old man, or
the <i>te-rain</i> may depart without thee,&rdquo; cried the banker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not only was it sufficient for the ticket, but for a little food
also,&rdquo; said Kim, leaping to his place. &ldquo;Now eat, Holy One. Look.
Day comes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Golden, rose, saffron, and pink, the morning mists smoked away across the flat
green levels. All the rich Punjab lay out in the splendour of the keen sun. The
lama flinched a little as the telegraph-posts swung by.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great is the speed of the <i>te-rain</i>,&rdquo; said the banker, with a
patronizing grin. &ldquo;We have gone farther since Lahore than thou couldst
walk in two days: at even, we shall enter Umballa.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And that is still far from Benares,&rdquo; said the lama wearily,
mumbling over the cakes that Kim offered. They all unloosed their bundles and
made their morning meal. Then the banker, the cultivator, and the soldier
prepared their pipes and wrapped the compartment in choking, acrid smoke,
spitting and coughing and enjoying themselves. The Sikh and the
cultivator&rsquo;s wife chewed <i>pan;</i> the lama took snuff and told his
beads, while Kim, cross-legged, smiled over the comfort of a full stomach.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What rivers have ye by Benares?&rdquo; said the lama of a sudden to the
carriage at large.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have Gunga,&rdquo; returned the banker, when the little titter had
subsided.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What others?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What other than Gunga?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, but in my mind was the thought of a certain River of
healing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is Gunga. Who bathes in her is made clean and goes to the Gods.
Thrice have I made pilgrimage to Gunga.&rdquo; He looked round proudly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There was need,&rdquo; said the young sepoy drily, and the
travellers&rsquo; laugh turned against the banker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Clean&mdash;to return again to the Gods,&rdquo; the lama muttered.
&ldquo;And to go forth on the round of lives anew&mdash;still tied to the
Wheel.&rdquo; He shook his head testily. &ldquo;But maybe there is a mistake.
Who, then, made Gunga in the beginning?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Gods. Of what known faith art thou?&rdquo; the banker said,
appalled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I follow the Law&mdash;the Most Excellent Law. So it was the Gods that
made Gunga. What like of Gods were they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The carriage looked at him in amazement. It was inconceivable that anyone
should be ignorant of Gunga.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&mdash;what is thy God?&rdquo; said the money-lender at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear!&rdquo; said the lama, shifting the rosary to his hand.
&ldquo;Hear: for I speak of Him now! O people of Hind, listen!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He began in Urdu the tale of the Lord Buddha, but, borne by his own thoughts,
slid into Tibetan and long-droned texts from a Chinese book of the
Buddha&rsquo;s life. The gentle, tolerant folk looked on reverently. All India
is full of holy men stammering gospels in strange tongues; shaken and consumed
in the fires of their own zeal; dreamers, babblers, and visionaries: as it has
been from the beginning and will continue to the end.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said the soldier of the Ludhiana Sikhs. &ldquo;There was a
Mohammedan regiment lay next to us at the Pirzai Kotal, and a priest of
theirs&mdash;he was, as I remember, a <i>naik</i>&mdash;when the fit was on
him, spake prophecies. But the mad all are in God&rsquo;s keeping. His officers
overlooked much in that man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama fell back on Urdu, remembering that he was in a strange land.
&ldquo;Hear the tale of the Arrow which our Lord loosed from the bow,&rdquo; he
said.
</p>

<p>
This was much more to their taste, and they listened curiously while he told
it. &ldquo;Now, O people of Hind, I go to seek that River. Know ye aught that
may guide me, for we be all men and women in evil case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is Gunga&mdash;and Gunga alone&mdash;who washes away sin.&rdquo;
ran the murmur round the carriage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Though past question we have good Gods Jullundur-way,&rdquo; said the
cultivator&rsquo;s wife, looking out of the window. &ldquo;See how they have
blessed the crops.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To search every river in the Punjab is no small matter,&rdquo; said her
husband. &ldquo;For me, a stream that leaves good silt on my land suffices, and
I thank Bhumia, the God of the Home-stead.&rdquo; He shrugged one knotted,
bronzed shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think you our Lord came so far North?&rdquo; said the lama, turning to
Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; Kim replied soothingly, as he spat red
<i>pan</i>-juice on the floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The last of the Great Ones,&rdquo; said the Sikh with authority,
&ldquo;was Sikander Julkarn [Alexander the Great]. He paved the streets of
Jullundur and built a great tank near Umballa. That pavement holds to this day;
and the tank is there also. I never heard of thy God.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let thy hair grow long and talk Punjabi,&rdquo; said the young soldier
jestingly to Kim, quoting a Northern proverb. &ldquo;That is all that makes a
Sikh.&rdquo; But he did not say this very loud.
</p>

<p>
The lama sighed and shrank into himself, a dingy, shapeless mass. In the pauses
of their talk they could hear the low droning &ldquo;<i>Om mane pudme hum! Om
mane pudme hum!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and the thick click of the wooden rosary
beads.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It irks me,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;The speed and the clatter irk
me. Moreover, my <i>chela</i>, I think that maybe we have over-passed that
River.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Peace, peace,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;Was not the River near Benares? We
are yet far from the place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;if our Lord came North, it may be any one of these little ones
that we have run across.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But thou wast sent to me&mdash;wast thou sent to me?&mdash;for the merit
I had acquired over yonder at Such-zen. From beside the cannon didst thou
come&mdash;bearing two faces&mdash;and two garbs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Peace. One must not speak of these things here,&rdquo; whispered Kim.
&ldquo;There was but one of me. Think again and thou wilt remember. A
boy&mdash;a Hindu boy&mdash;by the great green cannon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But was there not also an Englishman with a white beard holy among
images&mdash;who himself made more sure my assurance of the River of the
Arrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&mdash;we&mdash;went to the Ajaib-Gher in Lahore to pray before the
Gods there,&rdquo; Kim explained to the openly listening company. &ldquo;And
the Sahib of the Wonder House talked to him&mdash;yes, this is truth as a
brother. He is a very holy man, from far beyond the Hills. Rest, thou. In time
we come to Umballa.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But my River&mdash;the River of my healing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then, if it please thee, we will go hunting for that River on foot.
So that we miss nothing&mdash;not even a little rivulet in a field-side.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But thou hast a Search of thine own?&rdquo; The lama&mdash;very pleased
that he remembered so well&mdash;sat bolt upright.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Kim, humouring him. The boy was entirely happy to be out
chewing <i>pan</i> and seeing new people in the great good-tempered world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a bull&mdash;a Red Bull that shall come and help thee and carry
thee&mdash;whither? I have forgotten. A Red Bull on a green field, was it
not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, it will carry me nowhere,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;It is but a tale
I told thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; The cultivator&rsquo;s wife leaned forward, her
bracelets clinking on her arm. &ldquo;Do ye both dream dreams? A Red Bull on a
green field, that shall carry thee to the heavens or what? Was it a vision? Did
one make a prophecy? <i>We</i> have a Red Bull in our village behind Jullundur
city, and he grazes by choice in the very greenest of our fields!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give a woman an old wife&rsquo;s tale and a weaver-bird a leaf and a
thread&rdquo;, they will weave wonderful things,&rdquo; said the Sikh.
&ldquo;All holy men dream dreams, and by following holy men their disciples
attain that power.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A Red Bull on a green field, was it?&rdquo; the lama repeated. &ldquo;In
a former life it may be thou hast acquired merit, and the Bull will come to
reward thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay&mdash;nay&mdash;it was but a tale one told to me&mdash;for a jest
belike. But I will seek the Bull about Umballa, and thou canst look for thy
River and rest from the clatter of the train.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It may be that the Bull knows&mdash;that he is sent to guide us
both.&rdquo; said the lama, hopefully as a child. Then to the company,
indicating Kim: &ldquo;This one was sent to me but yesterday. He is not, I
think, of this world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beggars aplenty have I met, and holy men to boot, but never such a
<i>yogi</i> nor such a disciple,&rdquo; said the woman.
</p>

<p>
Her husband touched his forehead lightly with one finger and smiled. But the
next time the lama would eat they took care to give him of their best.
</p>

<p>
And at last&mdash;tired, sleepy, and dusty&mdash;they reached Umballa City
Station.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We abide here upon a law-suit,&rdquo; said the cultivator&rsquo;s wife
to Kim. &ldquo;We lodge with my man&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s younger brother.
There is room also in the courtyard for thy <i>yogi</i> and for thee.
Will&mdash;will he give me a blessing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O holy man! A woman with a heart of gold gives us lodging for the night.
It is a kindly land, this land of the South. See how we have been helped since
the dawn!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama bowed his head in benediction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To fill my cousin&rsquo;s younger brother&rsquo;s house with
wastrels&mdash;&rdquo; the husband began, as he shouldered his heavy bamboo
staff.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thy cousin&rsquo;s younger brother owes my father&rsquo;s cousin
something yet on his daughter&rsquo;s marriage-feast,&rdquo; said the woman
crisply. &ldquo;Let him put their food to that account. The <i>yogi</i> will
beg, I doubt not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, I beg for him,&rdquo; said Kim, anxious only to get the lama under
shelter for the night, that he might seek Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s Englishman and
deliver himself of the white stallion&rsquo;s pedigree.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, when the lama had come to an anchor in the inner
courtyard of a decent Hindu house behind the cantonments, &ldquo;I go away for
a while&mdash;to&mdash;to buy us victual in the bazar. Do not stray abroad till
I return.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou wilt return? Thou wilt surely return?&rdquo; The old man caught at
his wrist. &ldquo;And thou wilt return in this very same shape? Is it too late
to look tonight for the River?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too late and too dark. Be comforted. Think how far thou art on the
road&mdash;an hundred <i>kos</i> from Lahore already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yea&mdash;and farther from my monastery. Alas! It is a great and
terrible world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim stole out and away, as unremarkable a figure as ever carried his own and a
few score thousand other folk&rsquo;s fate slung round his neck. Mahbub
Ali&rsquo;s directions left him little doubt of the house in which his
Englishman lived; and a groom, bringing a dog-cart home from the Club, made him
quite sure. It remained only to identify his man, and Kim slipped through the
garden hedge and hid in a clump of plumed grass close to the veranda. The house
blazed with lights, and servants moved about tables dressed with flowers,
glass, and silver. Presently forth came an Englishman, dressed in black and
white, humming a tune. It was too dark to see his face, so Kim, beggar-wise,
tried an old experiment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Protector of the Poor!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man backed towards the voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mahbub Ali says&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hah! What says Mahbub Ali?&rdquo; He made no attempt to look for the
speaker, and that showed Kim that he knew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What proof is there?&rdquo; The Englishman switched at the rose-hedge in
the side of the drive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mahbub Ali has given me this proof.&rdquo; Kim flipped the wad of folded
paper into the air, and it fell in the path beside the man, who put his foot on
it as a gardener came round the corner. When the servant passed he picked it
up, dropped a rupee&mdash;Kim could hear the clink&mdash;and strode into the
house, never turning round. Swiftly Kim took up the money; but for all his
training, he was Irish enough by birth to reckon silver the least part of any
game. What he desired was the visible effect of action; so, instead of slinking
away, he lay close in the grass and wormed nearer to the house.
</p>

<p>
He saw&mdash;Indian bungalows are open through and through&mdash;the Englishman
return to a small dressing-room, in a comer of the veranda, that was half
office, littered with papers and despatch-boxes, and sit down to study Mahbub
Ali&rsquo;s message. His face, by the full ray of the kerosene lamp, changed
and darkened, and Kim, used as every beggar must be to watching countenances,
took good note.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will! Will, dear!&rdquo; called a woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;You ought
to be in the drawing-room. They&rsquo;ll be here in a minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man still read intently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will!&rdquo; said the voice, five minutes later.
&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> come. I can hear the troopers in the drive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man dashed out bareheaded as a big landau with four native troopers behind
it halted at the veranda, and a tall, black haired man, erect as an arrow,
swung out, preceded by a young officer who laughed pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
Flat on his belly lay Kim, almost touching the high wheels. His man and the
black stranger exchanged two sentences.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; said the young officer promptly.
&ldquo;Everything waits while a horse is concerned.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t be more than twenty minutes,&rdquo; said Kim&rsquo;s
man. &ldquo;You can do the honours&mdash;keep &rsquo;em amused, and all
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell one of the troopers to wait,&rdquo; said the tall man, and they
both passed into the dressing-room together as the landau rolled away. Kim saw
their heads bent over Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s message, and heard the
voices&mdash;one low and deferential, the other sharp and decisive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question of weeks. It is a question of days&mdash;hours
almost,&rdquo; said the elder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been expecting it for some
time, but this&rdquo;&mdash;he tapped Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s
paper&mdash;&ldquo;clinches it. Grogan&rsquo;s dining here to-night,
isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, and Macklin too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good. I&rsquo;ll speak to them myself. The matter will be referred
to the Council, of course, but this is a case where one is justified in
assuming that we take action at once. Warn the Pined and Peshawar brigades. It
will disorganize all the summer reliefs, but we can&rsquo;t help that. This
comes of not smashing them thoroughly the first time. Eight thousand should be
enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about artillery, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must consult Macklin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then it means war?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. Punishment. When a man is bound by the action of his
predecessor&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But C25 may have lied.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He bears out the other&rsquo;s information. Practically, they showed
their hand six months back. But Devenish would have it there was a chance of
peace. Of course they used it to make themselves stronger. Send off those
telegrams at once&mdash;the new code, not the old&mdash;mine and
Wharton&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t think we need keep the ladies waiting any
longer. We can settle the rest over the cigars. I thought it was coming.
It&rsquo;s punishment&mdash;not war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the trooper cantered off, Kim crawled round to the back of the house, where,
going on his Lahore experiences, he judged there would be food&mdash;and
information. The kitchen was crowded with excited scullions, one of whom kicked
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aie,&rdquo; said Kim, feigning tears. &ldquo;I came only to wash dishes
in return for a bellyful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All Umballa is on the same errand. Get hence. They go in now with the
soup. Think you that we who serve Creighton Sahib need strange scullions to
help us through a big dinner?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a very big dinner,&rdquo; said Kim, looking at the plates.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Small wonder. The guest of honour is none other than the Jang-i-Lat
Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief].&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Kim, with the correct guttural note of wonder. He had
learned what he wanted, and when the scullion turned he was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And all that trouble,&rdquo; said he to himself, thinking as usual in
Hindustani, &ldquo;for a horse&rsquo;s pedigree! Mahbub Ali should have come to
me to learn a little lying. Every time before that I have borne a message it
concerned a woman. Now it is men. Better. The tall man said that they will
loose a great army to punish someone&mdash;somewhere&mdash;the news goes to
Pindi and Peshawur. There are also guns. Would I had crept nearer. It is big
news!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He returned to find the cultivator&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s younger brother
discussing the family law-suit in all its bearings with the cultivator and his
wife and a few friends, while the lama dozed. After the evening meal some one
passed him a water-pipe; and Kim felt very much of a man as he pulled at the
smooth coconut-shell, his legs spread abroad in the moonlight, his tongue
clicking in remarks from time to time. His hosts were most polite; for the
cultivator&rsquo;s wife had told them of his vision of the Red Bull, and of his
probable descent from another world. Moreover, the lama was a great and
venerable curiosity.
</p>

<p>
The family priest, an old, tolerant Sarsut Brahmin, dropped in later, and
naturally started a theological argument to impress the family. By creed, of
course, they were all on their priest&rsquo;s side, but the lama was the guest
and the novelty. His gentle kindliness, and his impressive Chinese quotations,
that sounded like spells, delighted them hugely; and in this sympathetic,
simple air, he expanded like the Bodhisat&rsquo;s own lotus, speaking of his
life in the great hills of Such-zen, before, as he said, &ldquo;I rose up to
seek enlightenment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then it came out that in those worldly days he had been a master-hand at
casting horoscopes and nativities; and the family priest led him on to describe
his methods; each giving the planets names that the other could not understand,
and pointing upwards as the big stars sailed across the dark. The children of
the house tugged unrebuked at his rosary; and he clean forgot the Rule which
forbids looking at women as he talked of enduring snows, landslips, blocked
passes, the remote cliffs where men find sapphires and turquoise, and that
wonderful upland road that leads at last into Great China itself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How thinkest thou of this one?&rdquo; said the cultivator aside to the
priest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A holy man&mdash;a holy man indeed. His Gods are not the Gods, but his
feet are upon the Way,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;And his methods of
nativities, though that is beyond thee, are wise and sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Kim lazily, &ldquo;whether I find my Red Bull on a
green field, as was promised me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What knowledge hast thou of thy birth-hour?&rdquo; the priest asked,
swelling with importance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Between first and second cockcrow of the first night in May.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of what year?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know; but upon the hour that I cried first fell the great
earthquake in Srinagar which is in Kashmir.&rdquo; This Kim had from the woman
who took care of him, and she again from Kimball O&rsquo;Hara. The earthquake
had been felt in India, and for long stood a leading date in the Punjab.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ai!&rdquo; said a woman excitedly. This seemed to make Kim&rsquo;s
supernatural origin more certain. &ldquo;Was not such an one&rsquo;s daughter
born then&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And her mother bore her husband four sons in four years all likely
boys,&rdquo; cried the cultivator&rsquo;s wife, sitting outside the circle in
the shadow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None reared in the knowledge,&rdquo; said the family priest,
&ldquo;forget how the planets stood in their Houses upon that night.&rdquo; He
began to draw in the dust of the courtyard. &ldquo;At least thou hast good
claim to a half of the House of the Bull. How runs thy prophecy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon a day,&rdquo; said Kim, delighted at the sensation he was creating,
&ldquo;I shall be made great by means of a Red Bull on a green field, but first
there will enter two men making all things ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes: thus ever at the opening of a vision. A thick darkness that clears
slowly; anon one enters with a broom making ready the place. Then begins the
Sight. Two men&mdash;thou sayest? Ay, ay. The Sun, leaving the House of the
Bull, enters that of the Twins. Hence the two men of the prophecy. Let us now
consider. Fetch me a twig, little one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knitted his brows, scratched, smoothed out, and scratched again in the dust
mysterious signs&mdash;to the wonder of all save the lama, who, with fine
instinct, forbore to interfere.
</p>

<p>
At the end of half an hour, he tossed the twig from him with a grunt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hm! Thus say the stars. Within three days come the two men to make all
things ready. After them follows the Bull; but the sign over against him is the
sign of War and armed men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There was indeed a man of the Ludhiana Sikhs in the carriage from
Lahore,&rdquo; said the cultivator&rsquo;s wife hopefully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tck! Armed men&mdash;many hundreds. What concern hast thou with
war?&rdquo; said the priest to Kim. &ldquo;Thine is a red and an angry sign of
War to be loosed very soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None&mdash;none.&rdquo; said the lama earnestly. &ldquo;We seek only
peace and our River.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim smiled, remembering what he had overheard in the dressing-room. Decidedly
he was a favourite of the stars.
</p>

<p>
The priest brushed his foot over the rude horoscope. &ldquo;More than this I
cannot see. In three days comes the Bull to thee, boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And my River, my River,&rdquo; pleaded the lama. &ldquo;I had hoped his
Bull would lead us both to the River.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas, for that wondrous River, my brother,&rdquo; the priest replied.
&ldquo;Such things are not common.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Next morning, though they were pressed to stay, the lama insisted on departure.
They gave Kim a large bundle of good food and nearly three annas in copper
money for the needs of the road, and with many blessings watched the two go
southward in the dawn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pity it is that these and such as these could not be freed
from&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, then would only evil people be left on the earth, and who would
give us meat and shelter?&rdquo; quoth Kim, stepping merrily under his burden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yonder is a small stream. Let us look,&rdquo; said the lama, and he led
from the white road across the fields; walking into a very hornets&rsquo; nest
of pariah dogs.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="poem">
Yea, voice of every Soul that clung<br />
To life that strove from rung to rung<br />
When Devadatta&rsquo;s rule was young,<br />
    The warm wind brings Kamakura.
</p>

<p>
Behind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole. He was a market-gardener,
Arain by caste, growing vegetables and flowers for Umballa city, and well Kim
knew the breed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such an one,&rdquo; said the lama, disregarding the dogs, &ldquo;is
impolite to strangers, intemperate of speech and uncharitable. Be warned by his
demeanour, my disciple.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ho, shameless beggars!&rdquo; shouted the farmer. &ldquo;Begone! Get
hence!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We go,&rdquo; the lama returned, with quiet dignity. &ldquo;We go from
these unblessed fields.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Kim, sucking in his breath. &ldquo;If the next crops
fail, thou canst only blame thine own tongue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man shuffled uneasily in his slippers. &ldquo;The land is full of
beggars,&rdquo; he began, half apologetically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee, O
Mali?&rdquo; said Kim tartly, using the name that a market-gardener least
likes. &ldquo;All we sought was to look at that river beyond the field
there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;River, forsooth!&rdquo; the man snorted. &ldquo;What city do ye hail
from not to know a canal-cut? It runs as straight as an arrow, and I pay for
the water as though it were molten silver. There is a branch of a river beyond.
But if ye need water I can give that&mdash;and milk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, we will go to the river,&rdquo; said the lama, striding out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Milk and a meal.&rdquo; the man stammered, as he looked at the strange
tall figure. &ldquo;I&mdash;I would not draw evil upon myself&mdash;or my
crops. But beggars are so many in these hard days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take notice.&rdquo; The lama turned to Kim. &ldquo;He was led to speak
harshly by the Red Mist of anger. That clearing from his eyes, he becomes
courteous and of an affable heart. May his fields be blessed! Beware not to
judge men too hastily, O farmer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from hearthstone to
byre,&rdquo; said Kim to the abashed man. &ldquo;Is he not wise and holy? I am
his disciple.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He cocked his nose in the air loftily and stepped across the narrow
field-borders with great dignity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no pride,&rdquo; said the lama, after a pause, &ldquo;there is
no pride among such as follow the Middle Way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But thou hast said he was low-caste and discourteous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Low-caste I did not say, for how can that be which is not? Afterwards he
amended his discourtesy, and I forgot the offence. Moreover, he is as we are,
bound upon the Wheel of Things; but he does not tread the way of
deliverance.&rdquo; He halted at a little runlet among the fields, and
considered the hoof-pitted bank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, how wilt thou know thy River?&rdquo; said Kim, squatting in the
shade of some tall sugar-cane.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I find it, an enlightenment will surely be given. This, I feel, is
not the place. O littlest among the waters, if only thou couldst tell me where
runs my River! But be thou blessed to make the fields bear!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; Kim sprang to his side and dragged him back. A
yellow-and-brown streak glided from the purple rustling stems to the bank,
stretched its neck to the water, drank, and lay still&mdash;a big cobra with
fixed, lidless eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no stick&mdash;I have no stick,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;I will
get me one and break his back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why? He is upon the Wheel as we are&mdash;a life ascending or
descending&mdash;very far from deliverance. Great evil must the soul have done
that is cast into this shape.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hate all snakes,&rdquo; said Kim. No native training can quench the
white man&rsquo;s horror of the Serpent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him live out his life.&rdquo; The coiled thing hissed and half
opened its hood. &ldquo;May thy release come soon, brother!&rdquo; the lama
continued placidly. &ldquo;Hast <i>thou</i> knowledge, by chance, of my
River?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never have I seen such a man as thou art,&rdquo; Kim whispered,
overwhelmed. &ldquo;Do the very snakes understand thy talk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; He passed within a foot of the cobra&rsquo;s poised
head. It flattened itself among the dusty coils.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, thou!&rdquo; he called over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Kim&rdquo;. &ldquo;I go round.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come. He does no hurt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim hesitated for a moment. The lama backed his order by some droned Chinese
quotation which Kim took for a charm. He obeyed and bounded across the rivulet,
and the snake, indeed, made no sign.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never have I seen such a man.&rdquo; Kim wiped the sweat from his
forehead. &ldquo;And now, whither go we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is for thee to say. I am old, and a stranger&mdash;far from my own
place. But that the <i>rêl</i>-carriage fills my head with noises of
devil-drums I would go in it to Benares now ... Yet by so going we may miss the
River. Let us find another river.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Where the hard-worked soil gives three and even four crops a year through
patches of sugar-cane, tobacco, long white radishes, and nol-kol, all that day
they strolled on, turning aside to every glimpse of water; rousing village dogs
and sleeping villages at noonday; the lama replying to the volleyed questions
with an unswerving simplicity. They sought a River: a River of miraculous
healing. Had any one knowledge of such a stream?
</p>

<p>
Sometimes men laughed, but more often heard the story out to the end and
offered them a place in the shade, a drink of milk, and a meal. The women were
always kind, and the little children as children are the world over,
alternately shy and venturesome.
</p>

<p>
Evening found them at rest under the village tree of a mud-walled, mud-roofed
hamlet, talking to the headman as the cattle came in from the grazing-grounds
and the women prepared the day&rsquo;s last meal. They had passed beyond the
belt of market-gardens round hungry Umballa, and were among the mile-wide green
of the staple crops.
</p>

<p>
He was a white-bearded and affable elder, used to entertaining strangers. He
dragged out a string bedstead for the lama, set warm cooked food before him,
prepared him a pipe, and, the evening ceremonies being finished in the village
temple, sent for the village priest.
</p>

<p>
Kim told the older children tales of the size and beauty of Lahore, of railway
travel, and such-like city things, while the men talked, slowly as their cattle
chew the cud.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot fathom it,&rdquo; said the headman at last to the priest.
&ldquo;How readest thou this talk?&rdquo; The lama, his tale told, was silently
telling his beads.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a Seeker.&rdquo; the priest answered. &ldquo;The land is full of
such. Remember him who came only last, month&mdash;the <i>faquir</i> with the
tortoise?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but that man had right and reason, for Krishna Himself appeared in a
vision promising him Paradise without the burning-pyre if he journeyed to
Prayag. This man seeks no God who is within my knowledge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Peace, he is old: he comes from far off, and he is mad,&rdquo; the
smooth-shaven priest replied. &ldquo;Hear me.&rdquo; He turned to the lama.
&ldquo;Three <i>kos</i> (six miles) to the westward runs the great road to
Calcutta.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I would go to Benares&mdash;to Benares.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And to Benares also. It crosses all streams on this side of Hind. Now my
word to thee, Holy One, is rest here till tomorrow. Then take the road&rdquo;
(it was the Grand Trunk Road he meant) &ldquo;and test each stream that it
overpasses; for, as I understand, the virtue of thy River lies neither in one
pool nor place, but throughout its length. Then, if thy Gods will, be assured
that thou wilt come upon thy freedom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is well said.&rdquo; The lama was much impressed by the plan.
&ldquo;We will begin tomorrow, and a blessing on thee for showing old feet such
a near road.&rdquo; A deep, sing-song Chinese half-chant closed the sentence.
Even the priest was impressed, and the headman feared an evil spell: but none
could look at the lama&rsquo;s simple, eager face and doubt him long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seest thou my <i>chela?</i>&rdquo; he said, diving into his snuff-gourd
with an important sniff. It was his duty to repay courtesy with courtesy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see&mdash;and hear.&rdquo; The headman rolled his eye where Kim was
chatting to a girl in blue as she laid crackling thorns on a fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He also has a Search of his own. No river, but a Bull. Yea, a Red Bull
on a green field will some day raise him to honour. He is, I think, not
altogether of this world. He was sent of a sudden to aid me in this search, and
his name is Friend of all the World.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The priest smiled. &ldquo;Ho, there, Friend of all the World,&rdquo; he cried
across the sharp-smelling smoke, &ldquo;what art thou?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This Holy One&rsquo;s disciple,&rdquo; said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says thou are a <i>būt</i> (a spirit).&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can <i>būts</i> eat?&rdquo; said Kim, with a twinkle. &ldquo;For I am
hungry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is no jest,&rdquo; cried the lama. &ldquo;A certain astrologer of
that city whose name I have forgotten&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is no more than the city of Umballa where we slept last
night,&rdquo; Kim whispered to the priest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, Umballa was it? He cast a horoscope and declared that my
<i>chela</i> should find his desire within two days. But what said he of the
meaning of the stars, Friend of all the World?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim cleared his throat and looked around at the village greybeards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The meaning of my Star is War,&rdquo; he replied pompously.
</p>

<p>
Somebody laughed at the little tattered figure strutting on the brickwork
plinth under the great tree. Where a native would have lain down, Kim&rsquo;s
white blood set him upon his feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, War,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a sure prophecy,&rdquo; rumbled a deep voice. &ldquo;For there
is always war along the Border&mdash;as I know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was an old, withered man, who had served the Government in the days of the
Mutiny as a native officer in a newly raised cavalry regiment. The Government
had given him a good holding in the village, and though the demands of his
sons, now grey-bearded officers on their own account, had impoverished him, he
was still a person of consequence. English officials&mdash;Deputy Commissioners
even&mdash;turned aside from the main road to visit him, and on those occasions
he dressed himself in the uniform of ancient days, and stood up like a ramrod.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But this shall be a great war&mdash;a war of eight thousand.&rdquo;
Kim&rsquo;s voice shrilled across the quick-gathering crowd, astonishing
himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Redcoats or our own regiments?&rdquo; the old man snapped, as though he
were asking an equal. His tone made men respect Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Redcoats,&rdquo; said Kim at a venture. &ldquo;Redcoats and guns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;but the astrologer said no word of this,&rdquo; cried the
lama, snuffing prodigiously in his excitement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But <i>I</i> know. The word has come to me, who am this Holy One&rsquo;s
disciple. There will rise a war&mdash;a war of eight thousand redcoats. From
Pindi and Peshawur they will be drawn. This is sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy has heard bazar-talk,&rdquo; said the priest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he was always by my side,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;How should he
know? I did not know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He will make a clever juggler when the old man is dead,&rdquo; muttered
the priest to the headman. &ldquo;What new trick is this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A sign. Give me a sign,&rdquo; thundered the old soldier suddenly.
&ldquo;If there were war my sons would have told me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When all is ready, thy sons, doubt not, will be told. But it is a long
road from thy sons to the man in whose hands these things lie.&rdquo; Kim
warmed to the game, for it reminded him of experiences in the letter-carrying
line, when, for the sake of a few pice, he pretended to know more than he knew.
But now he was playing for larger things&mdash;the sheer excitement and the
sense of power. He drew a new breath and went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Old man, give <i>me</i> a sign. Do underlings order the goings of eight
thousand redcoats&mdash;with guns?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Still the old man answered as though Kim were an equal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dost thou know who He is, then, that gives the order?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have seen Him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To know again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have known Him since he was a lieutenant in the <i>top-khana</i> (the
Artillery).&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A tall man. A tall man with black hair, walking thus?&rdquo; Kim took a
few paces in a stiff, wooden style.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay. But that anyone may have seen.&rdquo; The crowd were
breathless&mdash;still through all this talk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;But I will say more. Look now.
First the great man walks thus. Then He thinks thus.&rdquo; (Kim drew a
forefinger over his forehead and downwards till it came to rest by the angle of
the jaw.) &ldquo;Anon He twitches his fingers thus. Anon He thrusts his hat
under his left armpit.&rdquo; Kim illustrated the motion and stood like a
stork.
</p>

<p>
The old man groaned, inarticulate with amazement; and the crowd shivered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So&mdash;so&mdash;so. But what does He when He is about to give an
order?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He rubs the skin at the back of his neck&mdash;thus. Then falls one
finger on the table and He makes a small sniffing noise through his nose. Then
He speaks, saying: &lsquo;Loose such and such a regiment. Call out such
guns.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man rose stiffly and saluted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;For&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Kim translated into the vernacular the
clinching sentences he had heard in the dressing-room at
Umballa&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;For,&rsquo; says He, &lsquo;we should have done
this long ago. It is not war&mdash;it is a chastisement. Snff!&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enough. I believe. I have seen Him thus in the smoke of battles. Seen
and heard. It is He!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw no smoke&rdquo;&mdash;Kim&rsquo;s voice shifted to the rapt
sing-song of the wayside fortune-teller. &ldquo;I saw this in darkness. First
came a man to make things clear. Then came horsemen. Then came He standing in a
ring of light. The rest followed as I have said. Old man, have I spoken
truth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is He. Past all doubt it is He.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The crowd drew a long, quavering breath, staring alternately at the old man,
still at attention, and ragged Kim against the purple twilight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Said I not&mdash;said I not he was from the other world?&rdquo; cried
the lama proudly. &ldquo;He is the Friend of all the World. He is the Friend of
the Stars!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At least it does not concern us,&rdquo; a man cried. &ldquo;O thou young
soothsayer, if the gift abides with thee at all seasons, I have a red-spotted
cow. She may be sister to thy Bull for aught I know&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or I care,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;My Stars do not concern themselves
with thy cattle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, but she is very sick,&rdquo; a woman struck in. &ldquo;My man is a
buffalo, or he would have chosen his words better. Tell me if she
recover?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Had Kim been at all an ordinary boy, he would have carried on the play; but one
does not know Lahore city, and least of all the <i>faquirs</i> by the Taksali
Gate, for thirteen years without also knowing human nature.
</p>

<p>
The priest looked at him sideways, something bitterly&mdash;a dry and blighting
smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there no priest, then, in the village? I thought I had seen a great
one even now,&rdquo; cried Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; the woman began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But thou and thy husband hoped to get the cow cured for a handful of
thanks.&rdquo; The shot told: they were notoriously the closest-fisted couple
in the village. &ldquo;It is not well to cheat the temples. Give a young calf
to thine own priest, and, unless thy Gods are angry past recall, she will give
milk within a month.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A master-beggar art thou,&rdquo; purred the priest approvingly.
&ldquo;Not the cunning of forty years could have done better. Surely thou hast
made the old man rich?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little flour, a little butter and a mouthful of cardamoms,&rdquo; Kim
retorted, flushed with the praise, but still cautious&mdash;&ldquo;Does one
grow rich on that? And, as thou canst see, he is mad. But it serves me while I
learn the road at least.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knew what the <i>faquirs</i> of the Taksali Gate were like when they talked
among themselves, and copied the very inflection of their lewd disciples.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is his Search, then, truth or a cloak to other ends? It may be
treasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is mad&mdash;many times mad. There is nothing else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here the old soldier bobbled up and asked if Kim would accept his hospitality
for the night. The priest recommended him to do so, but insisted that the
honour of entertaining the lama belonged to the temple&mdash;at which the lama
smiled guilelessly. Kim glanced from one face to the other, and drew his own
conclusions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is the money?&rdquo; he whispered, beckoning the old man off into
the darkness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In my bosom. Where else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give it me. Quietly and swiftly give it me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why? Here is no ticket to buy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I thy <i>chela</i>, or am I not? Do I not safeguard thy old feet
about the ways? Give me the money and at dawn I will return it.&rdquo; He
slipped his hand above the lama&rsquo;s girdle and brought away the purse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be it so&mdash;be it so.&rdquo; The old man nodded his head. &ldquo;This
is a great and terrible world. I never knew there were so many men alive in
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Next morning the priest was in a very bad temper, but the lama was quite happy;
and Kim had enjoyed a most interesting evening with the old man, who brought
out his cavalry sabre and, balancing it on his dry knees, told tales of the
Mutiny and young captains thirty years in their graves, till Kim dropped off to
sleep.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly the air of this country is good,&rdquo; said the lama.
&ldquo;I sleep lightly, as do all old men; but last night I slept unwaking till
broad day. Even now I am heavy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Drink a draught of hot milk,&rdquo; said Kim, who had carried not a few
such remedies to opium-smokers of his acquaintance. &ldquo;It is time to take
the Road again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The long Road that overpasses all the rivers of Hind,&rdquo; said the
lama gaily. &ldquo;Let us go. But how thinkest thou, <i>chela</i>, to
recompense these people, and especially the priest, for their great kindness?
Truly they are <i>būt-parast</i>, but in other lives, maybe, they will receive
enlightenment. A rupee to the temple? The thing within is no more than stone
and red paint, but the heart of man we must acknowledge when and where it is
good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Holy One, hast thou ever taken the Road alone?&rdquo; Kim looked up
sharply, like the Indian crows so busy about the fields.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely, child: from Kulu to Pathânkot&mdash;from Kulu, where my first
<i>chela</i> died. When men were kind to us we made offerings, and all men were
well-disposed throughout all the Hills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is otherwise in Hind,&rdquo; said Kim drily. &ldquo;Their Gods are
many-armed and malignant. Let them alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would set thee on thy road for a little, Friend of all the World, thou
and thy yellow man.&rdquo; The old soldier ambled up the village street, all
shadowy in the dawn, on a punt, scissor-hocked pony. &ldquo;Last night broke up
the fountains of remembrance in my so-dried heart, and it was as a blessing to
me. Truly there is war abroad in the air. I smell it. See! I have brought my
sword.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sat long-legged on the little beast, with the big sword at his
side&mdash;hand dropped on the pommel&mdash;staring fiercely over the flat
lands towards the North. &ldquo;Tell me again how He showed in thy vision. Come
up and sit behind me. The beast will carry two.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am this Holy One&rsquo;s disciple,&rdquo; said Kim, as they cleared
the village-gate. The villagers seemed almost sorry to be rid of them, but the
priest&rsquo;s farewell was cold and distant. He had wasted some opium on a man
who carried no money.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is well spoken. I am not much used to holy men, but respect is
always good. There is no respect in these days&mdash;not even when a
Commissioner Sahib comes to see me. But why should one whose Star leads him to
war follow a holy man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he <i>is</i> a holy man,&rdquo; said Kim earnestly. &ldquo;In truth,
and in talk and in act, holy. He is not like the others. I have never seen such
an one. We be not fortune-tellers, or jugglers, or beggars.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou art not. That I can see. But I do not know that other. He marches
well, though.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The first freshness of the day carried the lama forward with long, easy,
camel-like strides. He was deep in meditation, mechanically clicking his
rosary.
</p>

<p>
They followed the rutted and worn country road that wound across the flat
between the great dark-green mango-groves, the line of the snowcapped Himalayas
faint to the eastward. All India was at work in the fields, to the creaking of
well-wheels, the shouting of ploughmen behind their cattle, and the clamour of
the crows. Even the pony felt the good influence and almost broke into a trot
as Kim laid a hand on the stirrup-leather.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It repents me that I did not give a rupee to the shrine,&rdquo; said the
lama on the last bead of his eighty-one.
</p>

<p>
The old soldier growled in his beard, so that the lama for the first time was
aware of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seekest thou the River also?&rdquo; said he, turning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The day is new,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;What need of a river save
to water at before sundown? I come to show thee a short lane to the Big
Road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a courtesy to be remembered, O man of good will. But why the
sword?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old soldier looked as abashed as a child interrupted in his game of
make-believe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The sword,&rdquo; he said, fumbling it. &ldquo;Oh, that was a fancy of
mine an old man&rsquo;s fancy. Truly the police orders are that no man must
bear weapons throughout Hind, but&rdquo;&mdash;he cheered up and slapped the
hilt&mdash;&ldquo;all the constabeels hereabout know me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not a good fancy,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;What profit to kill
men?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very little&mdash;as I know; but if evil men were not now and then slain
it would not be a good world for weaponless dreamers. I do not speak without
knowledge who have seen the land from Delhi south awash with blood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What madness was that, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Gods, who sent it for a plague, alone know. A madness ate into all
the Army, and they turned against their officers. That was the first evil, but
not past remedy if they had then held their hands. But they chose to kill the
Sahibs&rsquo; wives and children. Then came the Sahibs from over the sea and
called them to most strict account.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some such rumour, I believe, reached me once long ago. They called it
the Black Year, as I remember.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What manner of life hast thou led, not to know The Year? A rumour
indeed! All earth knew, and trembled!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our earth never shook but once&mdash;upon the day that the Excellent One
received Enlightenment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Umph! I saw Delhi shake at least&mdash;and Delhi is the navel of the
world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So they turned against women and children? That was a bad deed, for
which the punishment cannot be avoided.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Many strove to do so, but with very small profit. I was then in a
regiment of cavalry. It broke. Of six hundred and eighty sabres stood fast to
their salt&mdash;how many, think you? Three. Of whom I was one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The greater merit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Merit! We did not consider it merit in those days. My people, my
friends, my brothers fell from me. They said: &lsquo;The time of the English is
accomplished. Let each strike out a little holding for himself.&rsquo; But I
had talked with the men of Sobraon, of Chilianwallah, of Moodkee and
Ferozeshah. I said: &lsquo;Abide a little and the wind turns. There is no
blessing in this work.&rsquo; In those days I rode seventy miles with an
English Memsahib and her babe on my saddle-bow. (Wow! That was a horse fit for
a man!) I placed them in safety, and back came I to my officer&mdash;the one
that was not killed of our five. &lsquo;Give me work,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for
I am an outcast among my own kind, and my cousin&rsquo;s blood is wet on my
sabre.&rsquo; &lsquo;Be content,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;There is great work
forward. When this madness is over there is a recompense.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, there is a recompense when the madness is over, surely?&rdquo; the
lama muttered half to himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They did not hang medals in those days on all who by accident had heard
a gun fired. No! In nineteen pitched battles was I; in six-and-forty skirmishes
of horse; and in small affairs without number. Nine wounds I bear; a medal and
four clasps and the medal of an Order, for my captains, who are now generals,
remembered me when the Kaisar-i-Hind had accomplished fifty years of her reign,
and all the land rejoiced. They said: &lsquo;Give him the Order of Berittish
India.&rsquo; I carry it upon my neck now. I have also my <i>jaghir</i>
(holding) from the hands of the State&mdash;a free gift to me and mine. The men
of the old days&mdash;they are now Commissioners&mdash;come riding to me
through the crops&mdash;high upon horses so that all the village sees&mdash;and
we talk out the old skirmishes, one dead man&rsquo;s name leading to
another.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And after?&rdquo; said the lama.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, afterwards they go away, but not before my village has seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And at the last what wilt thou do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the last I shall die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And after?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let the Gods order it. I have never pestered Them with prayers. I do not
think They will pester me. Look you, I have noticed in my long life that those
who eternally break in upon Those Above with complaints and reports and
bellowings and weepings are presently sent for in haste, as our Colonel used to
send for slack-jawed down-country men who talked too much. No, I have never
wearied the Gods. They will remember this, and give me a quiet place where I
can drive my lance in the shade, and wait to welcome my sons: I have no less
than three Rissaldar&mdash;majors all&mdash;in the regiments.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And they likewise, bound upon the Wheel, go forth from life to
life&mdash;from despair to despair,&rdquo; said the lama below his breath,
&ldquo;hot, uneasy, snatching.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; the old soldier chuckled. &ldquo;Three Rissaldar&mdash;majors
in three regiments. Gamblers a little, but so am I. They must be well mounted;
and one cannot take the horses as in the old days one took women. Well, well,
my holding can pay for all. How thinkest thou? It is a well-watered strip, but
my men cheat me. I do not know how to ask save at the lance&rsquo;s point. Ugh!
I grow angry and I curse them, and they feign penitence, but behind my back I
know they call me a toothless old ape.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hast thou never desired any other thing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;a thousand times! A straight back and a
close-clinging knee once more; a quick wrist and a keen eye; and the marrow
that makes a man. Oh, the old days&mdash;the good days of my strength!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That strength is weakness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It has turned so; but fifty years since I could have proved it
otherwise,&rdquo; the old soldier retorted, driving his stirrup-edge into the
pony&rsquo;s lean flank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I know a River of great healing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have drank Gunga-water to the edge of dropsy. All she gave me was a
flux, and no sort of strength.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not Gunga. The River that I know washes from all taint of sin.
Ascending the far bank one is assured of Freedom. I do not know thy life, but
thy face is the face of the honourable and courteous. Thou hast clung to thy
Way, rendering fidelity when it was hard to give, in that Black Year of which I
now remember other tales. Enter now upon the Middle Way which is the path to
Freedom. Hear the Most Excellent Law, and do not follow dreams.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speak, then, old man,&rdquo; the soldier smiled, half saluting.
&ldquo;We be all babblers at our age.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama squatted under the shade of a mango, whose shadow played checkerwise
over his face; the soldier sat stiffly on the pony; and Kim, making sure that
there were no snakes, lay down in the crotch of the twisted roots.
</p>

<p>
There was a drowsy buzz of small life in hot sunshine, a cooing of doves, and a
sleepy drone of well-wheels across the fields. Slowly and impressively the lama
began. At the end of ten minutes the old soldier slid from his pony, to hear
better as he said, and sat with the reins round his wrist. The lama&rsquo;s
voice faltered, the periods lengthened. Kim was busy watching a grey squirrel.
When the little scolding bunch of fur, close pressed to the branch,
disappeared, preacher and audience were fast asleep, the old officer&rsquo;s
strong-cut head pillowed on his arm, the lama&rsquo;s thrown back against the
tree-bole, where it showed like yellow ivory. A naked child toddled up, stared,
and, moved by some quick impulse of reverence, made a solemn little obeisance
before the lama&mdash;only the child was so short and fat that it toppled over
sideways, and Kim laughed at the sprawling, chubby legs. The child, scared and
indignant, yelled aloud.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hai! Hai!&rdquo; said the soldier, leaping to his feet. &ldquo;What is
it? What orders? ... It is ... a child! I dreamed it was an alarm. Little
one&mdash;little one&mdash;do not cry. Have I slept? That was discourteous
indeed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I fear! I am afraid!&rdquo; roared the child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it to fear? Two old men and a boy? How wilt thou ever make a
soldier, Princeling?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama had waked too, but, taking no direct notice of the child, clicked his
rosary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said the child, stopping a yell midway. &ldquo;I
have never seen such things. Give them me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha.&rdquo; said the lama, smiling, and trailing a loop of it on the
grass:
</p>

<p class="poem">
This is a handful of cardamoms,<br />     This is a lump of <i>ghi:</i><br />
This is millet and chillies and rice,<br />     A supper for thee and me!
</p>

<p>
The child shrieked with joy, and snatched at the dark, glancing beads.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said the old soldier. &ldquo;Whence hadst thou that song,
despiser of this world?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I learned it in Pathânkot&mdash;sitting on a doorstep,&rdquo; said the
lama shyly. &ldquo;It is good to be kind to babes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As I remember, before the sleep came on us, thou hadst told me that
marriage and bearing were darkeners of the true light, stumbling-blocks upon
the Way. Do children drop from Heaven in thy country? Is it the Way to sing
them songs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No man is all perfect,&rdquo; said the lama gravely, recoiling the
rosary. &ldquo;Run now to thy mother, little one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear him!&rdquo; said the soldier to Kim. &ldquo;He is ashamed for that
he has made a child happy. There was a very good householder lost in thee, my
brother. Hai, child!&rdquo; He threw it a pice. &ldquo;Sweetmeats are always
sweet.&rdquo; And as the little figure capered away into the sunshine:
&ldquo;They grow up and become men. Holy One, I grieve that I slept in the
midst of thy preaching. Forgive me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We be two old men,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;The fault is mine. I
listened to thy talk of the world and its madness, and one fault led to the
next.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear him! What harm do thy Gods suffer from play with a babe? And that
song was very well sung. Let us go on and I will sing thee the song of Nikal
Seyn before Delhi&mdash;the old song.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And they fared out from the gloom of the mango-tope, the old man&rsquo;s high,
shrill voice ringing across the field, as wail by long-drawn wail he unfolded
the story of Nikal Seyn [Nicholson]&mdash;the song that men sing in the Punjab
to this day. Kim was delighted, and the lama listened with deep interest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ahi! Nikal Seyn is dead&mdash;he died before Delhi! Lances of the
North, take vengeance for Nikal Seyn</i>.&rdquo; He quavered it out to the end,
marking the trills with the flat of his sword on the pony&rsquo;s rump.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now we come to the Big Road,&rdquo; said he, after receiving the
compliments of Kim; for the lama was markedly silent. &ldquo;It is long since I
have ridden this way, but thy boy&rsquo;s talk stirred me. See, Holy
One&mdash;the Great Road which is the backbone of all Hind. For the most part
it is shaded, as here, with four lines of trees; the middle road&mdash;all
hard&mdash;takes the quick traffic. In the days before rail-carriages the
Sahibs travelled up and down here in hundreds. Now there are only country-carts
and such like. Left and right is the rougher road for the heavy
carts&mdash;grain and cotton and timber, fodder, lime and hides. A man goes in
safety here for at every few <i>kos</i> is a police-station. The police are
thieves and extortioners (I myself would patrol it with cavalry&mdash;young
recruits under a strong captain), but at least they do not suffer any rivals.
All castes and kinds of men move here.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look! Brahmins and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers and bunnias,
pilgrims and potters&mdash;all the world going and coming. It is to me as a
river from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It runs straight,
bearing without crowding India&rsquo;s traffic for fifteen hundred
miles&mdash;such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world. They
looked at the green-arched, shade-flecked length of it, the white breadth
speckled with slow-pacing folk; and the two-roomed police-station opposite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who bears arms against the law?&rdquo; a constable called out
laughingly, as he caught sight of the soldier&rsquo;s sword. &ldquo;Are not the
police enough to destroy evil-doers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was because of the police I bought it,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;Does all go well in Hind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rissaldar Sahib, all goes well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am like an old tortoise, look you, who puts his head out from the bank
and draws it in again. Ay, this is the Road of Hindustan. All men come by this
way...&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Son of a swine, is the soft part of the road meant for thee to scratch
thy back upon? Father of all the daughters of shame and husband of ten thousand
virtueless ones, thy mother was devoted to a devil, being led thereto by her
mother. Thy aunts have never had a nose for seven generations! Thy
sister&mdash;What Owl&rsquo;s folly told thee to draw thy carts across the
road? A broken wheel? Then take a broken head and put the two together at
leisure!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The voice and a venomous whip-cracking came out of a pillar of dust fifty yards
away, where a cart had broken down. A thin, high Kathiawar mare, with eyes and
nostrils aflame, rocketed out of the jam, snorting and wincing as her rider
bent her across the road in chase of a shouting man. He was tall and
grey-bearded, sitting the almost mad beast as a piece of her, and
scientifically lashing his victim between plunges.
</p>

<p>
The old man&rsquo;s face lit with pride. &ldquo;My child!&rdquo; said he
briefly, and strove to rein the pony&rsquo;s neck to a fitting arch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I to be beaten before the police?&rdquo; cried the carter.
&ldquo;Justice! I will have Justice&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I to be blocked by a shouting ape who upsets ten thousand sacks under
a young horse&rsquo;s nose? That is the way to ruin a mare.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He speaks truth. He speaks truth. But she follows her man close,&rdquo;
said the old man. The carter ran under the wheels of his cart and thence
threatened all sorts of vengeance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are strong men, thy sons,&rdquo; said the policeman serenely,
picking his teeth.
</p>

<p>
The horseman delivered one last vicious cut with his whip and came on at a
canter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; He reigned back ten yards and dismounted.
</p>

<p>
The old man was off his pony in an instant, and they embraced as do father and
son in the East.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Then, lowering their voices, they spoke together. Kim came to rest under a
tree, but the lama tugged impatiently at his elbow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us go on. The River is not here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hai mai! Have we not walked enough for a little? Our River will not run
away. Patience, and he will give us a dole.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This.&rdquo; said the old soldier suddenly, &ldquo;is the Friend of the
Stars. He brought me the news yesterday. Having seen the very man Himself, in a
vision, giving orders for the war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; said his son, all deep in his broad chest. &ldquo;He came by
a bazar-rumour and made profit of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His father laughed. &ldquo;At least he did not ride to me begging for a new
charger, and the Gods know how many rupees. Are thy brothers&rsquo; regiments
also under orders?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know. I took leave and came swiftly to thee in
case&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In case they ran before thee to beg. O gamblers and spendthrifts all!
But thou hast never yet ridden in a charge. A good horse is needed there,
truly. A good follower and a good pony also for the marching. Let us
see&mdash;let us see.&rdquo; He thrummed on the pommel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is no place to cast accounts in, my father. Let us go to thy
house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At least pay the boy, then: I have no pice with me, and he brought
auspicious news. Ho! Friend of all the World, a war is toward as thou hast
said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, as I know, <i>the</i> war,&rdquo; returned Kim composedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said the lama, fingering his beads, all eager for the road.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My master does not trouble the Stars for hire. We brought the news bear
witness, we brought the news, and now we go.&rdquo; Kim half-crooked his hand
at his side.
</p>

<p>
The son tossed a silver coin through the sunlight, grumbling something about
beggars and jugglers. It was a four-anna piece, and would feed them well for
days. The lama, seeing the flash of the metal, droned a blessing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go thy way, Friend of all the World,&rdquo; piped the old soldier,
wheeling his scrawny mount. &ldquo;For once in all my days I have met a true
prophet&mdash;who was not in the Army.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Father and son swung round together: the old man sitting as erect as the
younger.
</p>

<p>
A Punjabi constable in yellow linen trousers slouched across the road. He had
seen the money pass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; he cried in impressive English. &ldquo;Know ye not that
there is a <i>takkus</i> of two annas a head, which is four annas, on those who
enter the Road from this side-road? It is the order of the Sirkar, and the
money is spent for the planting of trees and the beautification of the
ways.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the bellies of the police,&rdquo; said Kim, slipping out of
arm&rsquo;s reach. &ldquo;Consider for a while, man with a mud head. Think you
we came from the nearest pond like the frog, thy father-in-law? Hast thou ever
heard the name of thy brother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who was he? Leave the boy alone,&rdquo; cried a senior constable,
immensely delighted, as he squatted down to smoke his pipe in the veranda.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He took a label from a bottle of <i>belaitee-pani</i> (soda-water), and,
affixing it to a bridge, collected taxes for a month from those who passed,
saying that it was the Sirkar&rsquo;s order. Then came an Englishman and broke
his head. Ah, brother, I am a town-crow, not a village-crow!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The policeman drew back abashed, and Kim hooted at him all down the road.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was there ever such a disciple as I?&rdquo; he cried merrily to the
lama. &ldquo;All earth would have picked thy bones within ten mile of Lahore
city if I had not guarded thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I consider in my own mind whether thou art a spirit, sometimes, or
sometimes an evil imp,&rdquo; said the lama, smiling slowly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am thy <i>chela</i>.&rdquo; Kim dropped into step at his
side&mdash;that indescribable gait of the long-distance tramp all the world
over.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now let us walk,&rdquo; muttered the lama, and to the click of his
rosary they walked in silence mile upon mile. The lama as usual, was deep in
meditation, but Kim&rsquo;s bright eyes were open wide. This broad, smiling
river of life, he considered, was a vast improvement on the cramped and crowded
Lahore streets. There were new people and new sights at every
stride&mdash;castes he knew and castes that were altogether out of his
experience.
</p>

<p>
They met a troop of long-haired, strong-scented Sansis with baskets of lizards
and other unclean food on their backs, their lean dogs sniffing at their heels.
These people kept their own side of the road, moving at a quick, furtive
jog-trot, and all other castes gave them ample room; for the Sansi is deep
pollution. Behind them, walking wide and stiffly across the strong shadows, the
memory of his leg-irons still on him, strode one newly released from the jail;
his full stomach and shiny skin to prove that the Government fed its prisoners
better than most honest men could feed themselves. Kim knew that walk well, and
made broad jest of it as they passed. Then an Akali, a wild-eyed, wild-haired
Sikh devotee in the blue-checked clothes of his faith, with polished-steel
quoits glistening on the cone of his tall blue turban, stalked past, returning
from a visit to one of the independent Sikh States, where he had been singing
the ancient glories of the Khalsa to College-trained princelings in top-boots
and white-cord breeches. Kim was careful not to irritate that man; for the
Akali&rsquo;s temper is short and his arm quick. Here and there they met or
were overtaken by the gaily dressed crowds of whole villages turning out to
some local fair; the women, with their babes on their hips, walking behind the
men, the older boys prancing on sticks of sugar-cane, dragging rude brass
models of locomotives such as they sell for a halfpenny, or flashing the sun
into the eyes of their betters from cheap toy mirrors. One could see at a
glance what each had bought; and if there were any doubt it needed only to
watch the wives comparing, brown arm against brown arm, the newly purchased
dull glass bracelets that come from the North-West. These merry-makers stepped
slowly, calling one to the other and stopping to haggle with sweetmeat-sellers,
or to make a prayer before one of the wayside shrines&mdash;sometimes Hindu,
sometimes Mussalman&mdash;which the low-caste of both creeds share with
beautiful impartiality. A solid line of blue, rising and falling like the back
of a caterpillar in haste, would swing up through the quivering dust and trot
past to a chorus of quick cackling. That was a gang of
<i>changars</i>&mdash;the women who have taken all the embankments of all the
Northern railways under their charge&mdash;a flat-footed, big-bosomed,
strong-limbed, blue-petticoated clan of earth-carriers, hurrying north on news
of a job, and wasting no time by the road. They belong to the caste whose men
do not count, and they walked with squared elbows, swinging hips, and heads on
high, as suits women who carry heavy weights. A little later a marriage
procession would strike into the Grand Trunk with music and shoutings, and a
smell of marigold and jasmine stronger even than the reek of the dust. One
could see the bride&rsquo;s litter, a blur of red and tinsel, staggering
through the haze, while the bridegroom&rsquo;s bewreathed pony turned aside to
snatch a mouthful from a passing fodder-cart. Then Kim would join the
Kentish-fire of good wishes and bad jokes, wishing the couple a hundred sons
and no daughters, as the saying is. Still more interesting and more to be
shouted over it was when a strolling juggler with some half-trained monkeys, or
a panting, feeble bear, or a woman who tied goats&rsquo; horns to her feet, and
with these danced on a slack-rope, set the horses to shying and the women to
shrill, long-drawn quavers of amazement.
</p>

<p>
The lama never raised his eyes. He did not note the money-lender on his
goose-rumped pony, hastening along to collect the cruel interest; or the
long-shouting, deep-voiced little mob&mdash;still in military
formation&mdash;of native soldiers on leave, rejoicing to be rid of their
breeches and puttees, and saying the most outrageous things to the most
respectable women in sight. Even the seller of Ganges-water he did not see, and
Kim expected that he would at least buy a bottle of that precious stuff. He
looked steadily at the ground, and strode as steadily hour after hour, his soul
busied elsewhere. But Kim was in the seventh heaven of joy. The Grand Trunk at
this point was built on an embankment to guard against winter floods from the
foothills, so that one walked, as it were, a little above the country, along a
stately corridor, seeing all India spread out to left and right. It was
beautiful to behold the many-yoked grain and cotton wagons crawling over the
country roads: one could hear their axles, complaining a mile away, coming
nearer, till with shouts and yells and bad words they climbed up the steep
incline and plunged on to the hard main road, carter reviling carter. It was
equally beautiful to watch the people, little clumps of red and blue and pink
and white and saffron, turning aside to go to their own villages, dispersing
and growing small by twos and threes across the level plain. Kim felt these
things, though he could not give tongue to his feelings, and so contented
himself with buying peeled sugar-cane and spitting the pith generously about
his path. From time to time the lama took snuff, and at last Kim could endure
the silence no longer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a good land&mdash;the land of the South!&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;The air is good; the water is good. Eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And they are all bound upon the Wheel,&rdquo; said the lama.
&ldquo;Bound from life after life. To none of these has the Way been
shown.&rdquo; He shook himself back to this world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now we have walked a weary way,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;Surely we
shall soon come to a <i>parao</i> (a resting-place). Shall we stay there? Look,
the sun is sloping.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who will receive us this evening?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is all one. This country is full of good folk. Besides&rdquo; he
sunk his voice beneath a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;we have money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The crowd thickened as they neared the resting-place which marked the end of
their day&rsquo;s journey. A line of stalls selling very simple food and
tobacco, a stack of firewood, a police-station, a well, a horse-trough, a few
trees, and, under them, some trampled ground dotted with the black ashes of old
fires, are all that mark a <i>parao</i> on the Grand Trunk; if you except the
beggars and the crows&mdash;both hungry.
</p>

<p>
By this time the sun was driving broad golden spokes through the lower branches
of the mango-trees; the parakeets and doves were coming home in their hundreds;
the chattering, grey-backed Seven Sisters, talking over the day&rsquo;s
adventures, walked back and forth in twos and threes almost under the feet of
the travellers; and shufflings and scufflings in the branches showed that the
bats were ready to go out on the night-picket. Swiftly the light gathered
itself together, painted for an instant the faces and the cartwheels and the
bullocks&rsquo; horns as red as blood. Then the night fell, changing the touch
of the air, drawing a low, even haze, like a gossamer veil of blue, across the
face of the country, and bringing out, keen and distinct, the smell of
wood-smoke and cattle and the good scent of wheaten cakes cooked on ashes. The
evening patrol hurried out of the police-station with important coughings and
reiterated orders; and a live charcoal ball in the cup of a wayside
carter&rsquo;s hookah glowed red while Kim&rsquo;s eye mechanically watched the
last flicker of the sun on the brass tweezers.
</p>

<p>
The life of the <i>parao</i> was very like that of the Kashmir Serai on a small
scale. Kim dived into the happy Asiatic disorder which, if you only allow time,
will bring you everything that a simple man needs.
</p>

<p>
His wants were few, because, since the lama had no caste scruples, cooked food
from the nearest stall would serve; but, for luxury&rsquo;s sake, Kim bought a
handful of dung-cakes to build a fire. All about, coming and going round the
little flames, men cried for oil, or grain, or sweetmeats, or tobacco, jostling
one another while they waited their turn at the well; and under the men&rsquo;s
voices you heard from halted, shuttered carts the high squeals and giggles of
women whose faces should not be seen in public.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, well-educated natives are of opinion that when their womenfolk
travel&mdash;and they visit a good deal&mdash;it is better to take them quickly
by rail in a properly screened compartment; and that custom is spreading. But
there are always those of the old rock who hold by the use of their
forefathers; and, above all, there are always the old women&mdash;more
conservative than the men&mdash;who toward the end of their days go on a
pilgrimage. They, being withered and undesirable, do not, under certain
circumstances, object to unveiling. After their long seclusion, during which
they have always been in business touch with a thousand outside interests, they
love the bustle and stir of the open road, the gatherings at the shrines, and
the infinite possibilities of gossip with like-minded dowagers. Very often it
suits a longsuffering family that a strong-tongued, iron-willed old lady should
disport herself about India in this fashion; for certainly pilgrimage is
grateful to the Gods. So all about India, in the most remote places, as in the
most public, you find some knot of grizzled servitors in nominal charge of an
old lady who is more or less curtained and hid away in a bullock-cart. Such men
are staid and discreet, and when a European or a high-caste native is near will
net their charge with most elaborate precautions; but in the ordinary haphazard
chances of pilgrimage the precautions are not taken. The old lady is, after
all, intensely human, and lives to look upon life.
</p>

<p>
Kim marked down a gaily ornamented <i>ruth</i> or family bullock-cart, with a
broidered canopy of two domes, like a double-humped camel, which had just been
drawn into the <i>parao</i>. Eight men made its retinue, and two of the eight
were armed with rusty sabres&mdash;sure signs that they followed a person of
distinction, for the common folk do not bear arms. An increasing cackle of
complaints, orders, and jests, and what to a European would have been bad
language, came from behind the curtains. Here was evidently a woman used to
command.
</p>

<p>
Kim looked over the retinue critically. Half of them were thin-legged,
grey-bearded Ooryas from down country. The other half were duffle-clad,
felt-hatted hillmen of the North; and that mixture told its own tale, even if
he had not overheard the incessant sparring between the two divisions. The old
lady was going south on a visit&mdash;probably to a rich relative, most
probably to a son-in-law, who had sent up an escort as a mark of respect. The
hillmen would be of her own people&mdash;Kulu or Kangra folk. It was quite
clear that she was not taking her daughter down to be wedded, or the curtains
would have been laced home and the guard would have allowed no one near the
car. A merry and a high-spirited dame, thought Kim, balancing the dung-cake in
one hand, the cooked food in the other, and piloting the lama with a nudging
shoulder. Something might be made out of the meeting. The lama would give him
no help, but, as a conscientious <i>chela</i>, Kim was delighted to beg for
two.
</p>

<p>
He built his fire as close to the cart as he dared, waiting for one of the
escort to order him away. The lama dropped wearily to the ground, much as a
heavy fruit-eating bat cowers, and returned to his rosary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand farther off, beggar!&rdquo; The order was shouted in broken
Hindustani by one of the hillmen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Huh! It is only a <i>pahari</i> (a hillman)&rdquo;, said Kim over his
shoulder. &ldquo;Since when have the hill-asses owned all Hindustan?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The retort was a swift and brilliant sketch of Kim&rsquo;s pedigree for three
generations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Kim&rsquo;s voice was sweeter than ever, as he broke the
dung-cake into fit pieces. &ldquo;In<i> my</i> country we call that the
beginning of love-talk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A harsh, thin cackle behind the curtains put the hillman on his mettle for a
second shot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so bad&mdash;not so bad,&rdquo; said Kim with calm. &ldquo;But have
a care, my brother, lest we&mdash;<i>we</i>, I say&mdash;be minded to give a
curse or so in return. And our curses have the knack of biting home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Ooryas laughed; the hillman sprang forward threateningly. The lama suddenly
raised his head, bringing his huge tam-o&rsquo;-shanter hat into the full light
of Kim&rsquo;s new-started fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
The man halted as though struck to stone. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;am saved from
a great sin,&rdquo; he stammered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The foreigner has found him a priest at last,&rdquo; whispered one of
the Ooryas.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hai! Why is that beggar-brat not well beaten?&rdquo; the old woman
cried.
</p>

<p>
The hillman drew back to the cart and whispered something to the curtain. There
was dead silence, then a muttering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This goes well,&rdquo; thought Kim, pretending neither to see nor hear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When&mdash;when&mdash;he has eaten&rdquo;&mdash;the hillman fawned on
Kim&mdash;&ldquo;it&mdash;it is requested that the Holy One will do the honour
to talk to one who would speak to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After he has eaten he will sleep,&rdquo; Kim returned loftily. He could
not quite see what new turn the game had taken, but stood resolute to profit by
it. &ldquo;Now I will get him his food.&rdquo; The last sentence, spoken
loudly, ended with a sigh as of faintness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I myself and the others of my people will look to that&mdash;if
it is permitted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is permitted,&rdquo; said Kim, more loftily than ever. &ldquo;Holy
One, these people will bring us food.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The land is good. All the country of the South is good&mdash;a great and
a terrible world,&rdquo; mumbled the lama drowsily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him sleep,&rdquo; said Kim, &ldquo;but look to it that we are well
fed when he wakes. He is a very holy man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again one of the Ooryas said something contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is not a <i>faquir</i>. He is not a down-country beggar,&rdquo; Kim
went on severely, addressing the stars. &ldquo;He is the most holy of holy men.
He is above all castes. I am his <i>chela</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; said the flat thin voice behind the curtain; and Kim
came, conscious that eyes he could not see were staring at him. One skinny
brown finger heavy with rings lay on the edge of the cart, and the talk went
this way:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is that one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An exceedingly holy one. He comes from far off. He comes from
Tibet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where in Tibet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From behind the snows&mdash;from a very far place. He knows the stars;
he makes horoscopes; he reads nativities. But he does not do this for money. He
does it for kindness and great charity. I am his disciple. I am called also the
Friend of the Stars.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou art no hillman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ask him. He will tell thee I was sent to him from the Stars to show him
an end to his pilgrimage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humph! Consider, brat, that I am an old woman and not altogether a fool.
Lamas I know, and to these I give reverence, but thou art no more a lawful
<i>chela</i> than this my finger is the pole of this wagon. Thou art a
casteless Hindu&mdash;a bold and unblushing beggar, attached, belike, to the
Holy One for the sake of gain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do we not all work for gain?&rdquo; Kim changed his tone promptly to
match that altered voice. &ldquo;I have heard&rdquo;&mdash;this was a bow drawn
at a venture&mdash;&ldquo;I have heard&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What hast thou heard?&rdquo; she snapped, rapping with the finger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing that I well remember, but some talk in the bazars, which is
doubtless a lie, that even Rajahs&mdash;small Hill Rajahs&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But none the less of good Rajput blood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Assuredly of good blood. That these even sell the more comely of their
womenfolk for gain. Down south they sell them&mdash;to zemindars and
such&mdash;all of Oudh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If there be one thing in the world that the small Hill Rajahs deny it is just
this charge; but it happens to be one thing that the bazars believe, when they
discuss the mysterious slave-traffics of India. The old lady explained to Kim,
in a tense, indignant whisper, precisely what manner and fashion of malignant
liar he was. Had Kim hinted this when she was a girl, he would have been
pommelled to death that same evening by an elephant. This was perfectly true.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ahai! I am only a beggar&rsquo;s brat, as the Eye of Beauty has
said,&rdquo; he wailed in extravagant terror.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eye of Beauty, forsooth! Who am I that thou shouldst fling
beggar-endearments at me?&rdquo; And yet she laughed at the long-forgotten
word. &ldquo;Forty years ago that might have been said, and not without truth.
Ay. thirty years ago. But it is the fault of this gadding up and down Hind that
a king&rsquo;s widow must jostle all the scum of the land, and be made a mock
by beggars.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great Queen,&rdquo; said Kim promptly, for he heard her shaking with
indignation, &ldquo;I am even what the Great Queen says I am; but none the less
is my master holy. He has not yet heard the Great Queen&rsquo;s order
that&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Order? I order a Holy One&mdash;a Teacher of the Law&mdash;to come and
speak to a woman? Never!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pity my stupidity. I thought it was given as an order&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was not. It was a petition. Does this make all clear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A silver coin clicked on the edge of the cart. Kim took it and salaamed
profoundly. The old lady recognized that, as the eyes and the ears of the lama,
he was to be propitiated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am but the Holy One&rsquo;s disciple. When he has eaten perhaps he
will come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, villain and shameless rogue!&rdquo; The jewelled forefinger shook
itself at him reprovingly; but he could hear the old lady&rsquo;s chuckle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, what is it?&rdquo; he said, dropping into his most caressing and
confidential tone&mdash;the one, he well knew, that few could resist.
&ldquo;Is&mdash;is there any need of a son in thy family? Speak freely, for we
priests&mdash;&rdquo; That last was a direct plagiarism from a <i>faquir</i> by
the Taksali Gate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We priests! Thou art not yet old enough to&mdash;&rdquo; She checked the
joke with another laugh. &ldquo;Believe me, now and again, we women, O priest,
think of other matters than sons. Moreover, my daughter has borne her
man-child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Two arrows in the quiver are better than one; and three are better
still.&rdquo; Kim quoted the proverb with a meditative cough, looking
discreetly earthward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True&mdash;oh, true. But perhaps that will come. Certainly those
down-country Brahmins are utterly useless. I sent gifts and monies and gifts
again to them, and they prophesied.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; drawled Kim, with infinite contempt, &ldquo;they
prophesied!&rdquo; A professional could have done no better.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it was not till I remembered my own Gods that my prayers were heard.
I chose an auspicious hour, and&mdash;perhaps thy Holy One has heard of the
Abbot of the Lung-Cho lamassery. It was to him I put the matter, and behold in
the due time all came about as I desired. The Brahmin in the house of the
father of my daughter&rsquo;s son has since said that it was through <i>his</i>
prayers&mdash;which is a little error that I will explain to him when we reach
our journey&rsquo;s end. And so afterwards I go to Buddh Gaya, to make
<i>shraddha</i> for the father of my children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thither go we.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doubly auspicious,&rdquo; chirruped the old lady. &ldquo;A second son at
least!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Friend of all the World!&rdquo; The lama had waked, and, simply as a
child bewildered in a strange bed, called for Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I come! I come, Holy One!&rdquo; He dashed to the fire, where he found
the lama already surrounded by dishes of food, the hillmen visibly adoring him
and the Southerners looking sourly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go back! Withdraw!&rdquo; Kim cried. &ldquo;Do we eat publicly like
dogs?&rdquo; They finished the meal in silence, each turned a little from the
other, and Kim topped it with a native-made cigarette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have I not said an hundred times that the South is a good land? Here is
a virtuous and high-born widow of a Hill Rajah on pilgrimage, she says, to
Buddha Gay. She it is sends us those dishes; and when thou art well rested she
would speak to thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this also thy work?&rdquo; The lama dipped deep into his snuff-gourd.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who else watched over thee since our wonderful journey began?&rdquo;
Kim&rsquo;s eyes danced in his head as he blew the rank smoke through his
nostrils and stretched him on the dusty ground. &ldquo;Have I failed to oversee
thy comforts, Holy One?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A blessing on thee.&rdquo; The lama inclined his solemn head. &ldquo;I
have known many men in my so long life, and disciples not a few. But to none
among men, if so be thou art woman-born, has my heart gone out as it has to
thee&mdash;thoughtful, wise, and courteous; but something of a small
imp.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I have never seen such a priest as thou.&rdquo; Kim considered the
benevolent yellow face wrinkle by wrinkle. &ldquo;It is less than three days
since we took the road together, and it is as though it were a hundred
years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps in a former life it was permitted that I should have rendered
thee some service. Maybe&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;I freed thee from
a trap; or, having caught thee on a hook in the days when I was not
enlightened, cast thee back into the river.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Kim quietly. He had heard this sort of speculation
again and again, from the mouths of many whom the English would not consider
imaginative. &ldquo;Now, as regards that woman in the bullock-cart. <i>I</i>
think she needs a second son for her daughter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is no part of the Way,&rdquo; sighed the lama. &ldquo;But at least
she is from the Hills. Ah, the Hills, and the snow of the Hills!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He rose and stalked to the cart. Kim would have given his ears to come too, but
the lama did not invite him; and the few words he caught were in an unknown
tongue, for they spoke some common speech of the mountains. The woman seemed to
ask questions which the lama turned over in his mind before answering. Now and
again he heard the singsong cadence of a Chinese quotation. It was a strange
picture that Kim watched between drooped eyelids. The lama, very straight and
erect, the deep folds of his yellow clothing slashed with black in the light of
the <i>parao</i> fires precisely as a knotted tree-trunk is slashed with the
shadows of the low sun, addressed a tinsel and lacquered <i>ruth</i> which
burned like a many-coloured jewel in the same uncertain light. The patterns on
the gold-worked curtains ran up and down, melting and reforming as the folds
shook and quivered to the night wind; and when the talk grew more earnest the
jewelled forefinger snapped out little sparks of light between the
embroideries. Behind the cart was a wall of uncertain darkness speckled with
little flames and alive with half-caught forms and faces and shadows. The
voices of early evening had settled down to one soothing hum whose deepest note
was the steady chumping of the bullocks above their chopped straw, and whose
highest was the tinkle of a Bengali dancing-girl&rsquo;s <i>sitar</i>. Most men
had eaten and pulled deep at their gurgling, grunting hookahs, which in full
blast sound like bull-frogs.
</p>

<p>
At last the lama returned. A hillman walked behind him with a wadded
cotton-quilt and spread it carefully by the fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She deserves ten thousand grandchildren,&rdquo; thought Kim. &ldquo;None
the less, but for me, those gifts would not have come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A virtuous woman&mdash;and a wise one.&rdquo; The lama slackened off,
joint by joint, like a slow camel. &ldquo;The world is full of charity to those
who follow the Way.&rdquo; He flung a fair half of the quilt over Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what said she?&rdquo; Kim rolled up in his share of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She asked me many questions and propounded many problems&mdash;the most
of which were idle tales which she had heard from devil-serving priests who
pretend to follow the Way. Some I answered, and some I said were foolish. Many
wear the Robe, but few keep the Way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True. That is true.&rdquo; Kim used the thoughtful, conciliatory tone of
those who wish to draw confidences.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But by her lights she is most right-minded. She desires greatly that we
should go with her to Buddh Gaya; her road being ours, as I understand, for
many days&rsquo; journey to the southward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Patience a little. To this I said that my Search came before all things.
She had heard many foolish legends, but this great truth of my River she had
never heard. Such are the priests of the lower hills! She knew the Abbot of
Lung-Cho, but she did not know of my River&mdash;nor the tale of the
Arrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I spoke therefore of the Search, and of the Way, and of matters that
were profitable; she desiring only that I should accompany her and make prayer
for a second son.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha! &lsquo;We women&rsquo; do <i>not</i> think of anything save
children,&rdquo; said Kim sleepily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, since our roads run together for a while, I do not see that we in
any way depart from our Search if so be we accompany her&mdash;at least as far
as&mdash;I have forgotten the name of the city.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ohé!&rdquo; said Kim, turning and speaking in a sharp whisper to one of
the Ooryas a few yards away. &ldquo;Where is your master&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little behind Saharunpore, among the fruit gardens.&rdquo; He named
the village.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was the place,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;So far, at least, we
can go with her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Flies go to carrion,&rdquo; said the Oorya, in an abstracted voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the sick cow a crow; for the sick man a Brahmin.&rdquo; Kim breathed
the proverb impersonally to the shadow-tops of the trees overhead.
</p>

<p>
The Oorya grunted and held his peace.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So then we go with her, Holy One?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there any reason against? I can still step aside and try all the
rivers that the road overpasses. She desires that I should come. She very
greatly desires it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim stifled a laugh in the quilt. When once that imperious old lady had
recovered from her natural awe of a lama he thought it probable that she would
be worth listening to.
</p>

<p>
He was nearly asleep when the lama suddenly quoted a proverb: &ldquo;The
husbands of the talkative have a great reward hereafter.&rdquo; Then Kim heard
him snuff thrice, and dozed off, still laughing.
</p>

<p>
The diamond-bright dawn woke men and crows and bullocks together. Kim sat up
and yawned, shook himself, and thrilled with delight. This was seeing the world
in real truth; this was life as he would have it&mdash;bustling and shouting,
the buckling of belts, and beating of bullocks and creaking of wheels, lighting
of fires and cooking of food, and new sights at every turn of the approving
eye. The morning mist swept off in a whorl of silver, the parrots shot away to
some distant river in shrieking green hosts: all the well-wheels within
ear-shot went to work. India was awake, and Kim was in the middle of it, more
awake and more excited than anyone, chewing on a twig that he would presently
use as a toothbrush; for he borrowed right- and left-handedly from all the
customs of the country he knew and loved. There was no need to worry about
food&mdash;no need to spend a cowrie at the crowded stalls. He was the disciple
of a holy man annexed by a strong-willed old lady. All things would be prepared
for them, and when they were respectfully invited so to do they would sit and
eat. For the rest&mdash;Kim giggled here as he cleaned his teeth&mdash;his
hostess would rather heighten the enjoyment of the road. He inspected her
bullocks critically, as they came up grunting and blowing under the yokes. If
they went too fast&mdash;it was not likely&mdash;there would be a pleasant seat
for himself along the pole; the lama would sit beside the driver. The escort,
of course, would walk. The old lady, equally of course, would talk a great
deal, and by what he had heard that conversation would not lack salt. She was
already ordering, haranguing, rebuking, and, it must be said, cursing her
servants for delays.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get her her pipe. In the name of the Gods, get her her pipe and stop her
ill-omened mouth,&rdquo; cried an Oorya, tying up his shapeless bundles of
bedding. &ldquo;She and the parrots are alike. They screech in the dawn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The lead-bullocks! Hai! Look to the lead-bullocks!&rdquo; They were
backing and wheeling as a grain-cart&rsquo;s axle caught them by the horns.
&ldquo;Son of an owl, where dost thou go?&rdquo; This to the grinning carter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ai! Yai! Yai! That within there is the Queen of Delhi going to pray for
a son,&rdquo; the man called back over his high load. &ldquo;Room for the Queen
of Delhi and her Prime Minister the grey monkey climbing up his own
sword!&rdquo; Another cart loaded with bark for a down-country tannery followed
close behind, and its driver added a few compliments as the
<i>ruth</i>-bullocks backed and backed again.
</p>

<p>
From behind the shaking curtains came one volley of invective. It did not last
long, but in kind and quality, in blistering, biting appropriateness, it was
beyond anything that even Kim had heard. He could see the carter&rsquo;s bare
chest collapse with amazement, as the man salaamed reverently to the voice,
leaped from the pole, and helped the escort haul their volcano on to the main
road. Here the voice told him truthfully what sort of wife he had wedded, and
what she was doing in his absence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>shabash!</i>&rdquo; murmured Kim, unable to contain himself, as
the man slunk away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well done, indeed? It is a shame and a scandal that a poor woman may not
go to make prayer to her Gods except she be jostled and insulted by all the
refuse of Hindustan&mdash;that she must eat <i>gâli</i> (abuse) as men eat
<i>ghi</i>. But I have yet a wag left to my tongue&mdash;a word or two well
spoken that serves the occasion. And <i>still</i> am I without my tobacco! Who
is the one-eyed and luckless son of shame that has not yet prepared my
pipe?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was hastily thrust in by a hillman, and a trickle of thick smoke from each
corner of the curtains showed that peace was restored.
</p>

<p>
If Kim had walked proudly the day before, disciple of a holy man, today he
paced with tenfold pride in the train of a semi-royal procession, with a
recognized place under the patronage of an old lady of charming manners and
infinite resource. The escort, their heads tied up native-fashion, fell in on
either side the cart, shuffling enormous clouds of dust.
</p>

<p>
The lama and Kim walked a little to one side; Kim chewing his stick of
sugarcane, and making way for no one under the status of a priest. They could
hear the old lady&rsquo;s tongue clack as steadily as a rice-husker. She bade
the escort tell her what was going on on the road; and so soon as they were
clear of the <i>parao</i> she flung back the curtains and peered out, her veil
a third across her face. Her men did not eye her directly when she addressed
them, and thus the proprieties were more or less observed.
</p>

<p>
A dark, sallowish District Superintendent of Police, faultlessly uniformed, an
Englishman, trotted by on a tired horse, and, seeing from her retinue what
manner of person she was, chaffed her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O mother,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;do they do this in the <i>zenanas?</i>
Suppose an Englishman came by and saw that thou hast no nose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she shrilled back. &ldquo;Thine own mother has no nose? Why
say so, then, on the open road?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a fair counter. The Englishman threw up his hand with the gesture of a
man hit at sword-play. She laughed and nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this a face to tempt virtue aside?&rdquo; She withdrew all her veil
and stared at him.
</p>

<p>
It was by no means lovely, but as the man gathered up his reins he called it a
Moon of Paradise, a Disturber of Integrity, and a few other fantastic epithets
which doubled her up with mirth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a <i>nut-cut</i> (rogue),&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All
police-constables are <i>nut-cuts;</i> but the police-wallahs are the worst.
Hai, my son, thou hast never learned all that since thou camest from
<i>Belait</i> (Europe). Who suckled thee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A <i>pahareen</i>&mdash;a hillwoman of Dalhousie, my mother. Keep thy
beauty under a shade&mdash;O Dispenser of Delights,&rdquo; and he was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These be the sort&rdquo;&mdash;she took a fine judicial tone, and
stuffed her mouth with <i>pan</i>&mdash;&ldquo;These be the sort to oversee
justice. They know the land and the customs of the land. The others, all new
from Europe, suckled by white women and learning our tongues from books, are
worse than the pestilence. They do harm to Kings.&rdquo; Then she told a long,
long tale to the world at large, of an ignorant young policeman who had
disturbed some small Hill Rajah, a ninth cousin of her own, in the matter of a
trivial land-case, winding up with a quotation from a work by no means
devotional.
</p>

<p>
Then her mood changed, and she bade one of the escort ask whether the lama
would walk alongside and discuss matters of religion. So Kim dropped back into
the dust and returned to his sugar-cane. For an hour or more the lama&rsquo;s
tam-o&rsquo;shanter showed like a moon through the haze; and, from all he
heard, Kim gathered that the old woman wept. One of the Ooryas half apologized
for his rudeness overnight, saying that he had never known his mistress of so
bland a temper, and he ascribed it to the presence of the strange priest.
Personally, he believed in Brahmins, though, like all natives, he was acutely
aware of their cunning and their greed. Still, when Brahmins but irritated with
begging demands the mother of his master&rsquo;s wife, and when she sent them
away so angry that they cursed the whole retinue (which was the real reason of
the second off-side bullock going lame, and of the pole breaking the night
before), he was prepared to accept any priest of any other denomination in or
out of India. To this Kim assented with wise nods, and bade the Oorya observe
that the lama took no money, and that the cost of his and Kim&rsquo;s food
would be repaid a hundred times in the good luck that would attend the caravan
henceforward. He also told stories of Lahore city, and sang a song or two which
made the escort laugh. As a town-mouse well acquainted with the latest songs by
the most fashionable composers&mdash;they are women for the most part&mdash;Kim
had a distinct advantage over men from a little fruit-village behind
Saharunpore, but he let that advantage be inferred.
</p>

<p>
At noon they turned aside to eat, and the meal was good, plentiful, and
well-served on plates of clean leaves, in decency, out of drift of the dust.
They gave the scraps to certain beggars, that all requirements might be
fulfilled, and sat down to a long, luxurious smoke. The old lady had retreated
behind her curtains, but mixed most freely in the talk, her servants arguing
with and contradicting her as servants do throughout the East. She compared the
cool and the pines of the Kangra and Kulu hills with the dust and the mangoes
of the South; she told a tale of some old local Gods at the edge of her
husband&rsquo;s territory; she roundly abused the tobacco which she was then
smoking, reviled all Brahmins, and speculated without reserve on the coming of
many grandsons.

</p>

<p>
Once more the lazy, string-tied, shuffling procession got under way, and she
slept till they reached the next halting-stage. It was a very short march, and
time lacked an hour to sundown, so Kim cast about for means of amusement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why not sit and rest?&rdquo; said one of the escort. &ldquo;Only the
devils and the English walk to and fro without reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never make friends with the Devil, a Monkey, or a Boy. No man knows what
they will do next,&rdquo; said his fellow.
</p>

<p>
Kim turned a scornful back&mdash;he did not want to hear the old story how the
Devil played with the boys and repented of it and walked idly across country.
</p>

<p>
The lama strode after him. All that day, whenever they passed a stream, he had
turned aside to look at it, but in no case had he received any warning that he
had found his River. Insensibly, too, the comfort of speaking to someone in a
reasonable tongue, and of being properly considered and respected as her
spiritual adviser by a well-born woman, had weaned his thoughts a little from
the Search. And further, he was prepared to spend serene years in his quest;
having nothing of the white man&rsquo;s impatience, but a great faith.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where goest thou?&rdquo; he called after Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nowhither&mdash;it was a small march, and all this&rdquo;&mdash;Kim
waved his hands abroad&mdash;&ldquo;is new to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is beyond question a wise and a discerning woman. But it is hard to
meditate when&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All women are thus.&rdquo; Kim spoke as might have Solomon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Before the lamassery was a broad platform,&rdquo; the lama muttered,
looping up the well-worn rosary, &ldquo;of stone. On that I have left the marks
of my feet&mdash;pacing to and fro with these.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He clicked the beads, and began the &ldquo;<i>Om mane pudme hum</i>&rdquo; of
his devotion; grateful for the cool, the quiet, and the absence of dust.
</p>

<p>
One thing after another drew Kim&rsquo;s idle eye across the plain. There was
no purpose in his wanderings, except that the build of the huts near by seemed
new, and he wished to investigate.
</p>

<p>
They came out on a broad tract of grazing-ground, brown and purple in the
afternoon light, with a heavy clump of mangoes in the centre. It struck Kim as
curious that no shrine stood in so eligible a spot: the boy was observing as
any priest for these things. Far across the plain walked side by side four men,
made small by the distance. He looked intently under his curved palms and
caught the sheen of brass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Soldiers. White soldiers!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Let us see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is always soldiers when thou and I go out alone together. But I have
never seen the white soldiers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They do no harm except when they are drunk. Keep behind this
tree.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They stepped behind the thick trunks in the cool dark of the mango-tope. Two
little figures halted; the other two came forward uncertainly. They were the
advance-party of a regiment on the march, sent out, as usual, to mark the camp.
They bore five-foot sticks with fluttering flags, and called to each other as
they spread over the flat earth.
</p>

<p>
At last they entered the mango-grove, walking heavily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here or hereabouts&mdash;officers&rsquo; tents under the
trees, I take it, an&rsquo; the rest of us can stay outside. Have they marked
out for the baggage-wagons behind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They cried again to their comrades in the distance, and the rough answer came
back faint and mellowed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shove the flag in here, then,&rdquo; said one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do they prepare?&rdquo; said the lama, wonderstruck. &ldquo;This is
a great and terrible world. What is the device on the flag?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A soldier thrust a stave within a few feet of them, grunted discontentedly,
pulled it up again, conferred with his companion, who looked up and down the
shaded cave of greenery, and returned it.
</p>

<p>
Kim stared with all his eyes, his breath coming short and sharp between his
teeth. The soldiers stamped off into the sunshine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Holy One!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;My horoscope! The drawing in the
dust by the priest at Umballa! Remember what he said. First come
two&mdash;<i>ferashes</i>&mdash;to make all things ready&mdash;in a dark place,
as it is always at the beginning of a vision.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But this is not vision,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;It is the
world&rsquo;s Illusion, and no more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And after them comes the Bull&mdash;the Red Bull on the green field.
Look! It is he!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the flag that was snap snapping in the evening breeze not ten
feet away. It was no more than an ordinary camp marking-flag; but the regiment,
always punctilious in matters of millinery, had charged it with the regimental
device, the Red Bull, which is the crest of the Mavericks&mdash;the great Red
Bull on a background of Irish green.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see, and now I remember.&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;Certainly it is
thy Bull. Certainly, also, the two men came to make all ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are soldiers&mdash;white soldiers. What said the priest? &lsquo;The
sign over against the Bull is the sign of War and armed men.&rsquo; Holy One,
this thing touches my Search.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True. It is true.&rdquo; The lama stared fixedly at the device that
flamed like a ruby in the dusk. &ldquo;The priest at Umballa said that thine
was the sign of War.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is to do now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait. Let us wait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even now the darkness clears,&rdquo; said Kim. It was only natural that
the descending sun should at last strike through the tree-trunks, across the
grove, filling it with mealy gold light for a few minutes; but to Kim it was
the crown of the Umballa Brahmin&rsquo;s prophecy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;One beats a drum&mdash;far
off!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At first the sound, carrying diluted through the still air, resembled the
beating of an artery in the head. Soon a sharpness was added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! The music,&rdquo; Kim explained. He knew the sound of a regimental
band, but it amazed the lama.
</p>

<p>
At the far end of the plain a heavy, dusty column crawled in sight. Then the
wind brought the tune:
</p>

<p class="poem">
We crave your condescension<br />
To tell you what we know<br />
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards<br />
To Sligo Port below!
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Here broke in the shrill-tongued fifes:
</p>

<p class="poem">
We shouldered arms,<br />
We marched&mdash;we marched away.<br />
From Phœnix Park<br />
We marched to Dublin Bay.<br />
The drums and the fifes,<br />
Oh, sweetly they did play,<br />
As we marched&mdash;marched&mdash;marched&mdash;with the<br />
Mulligan Guards!
</p>

<p>
It was the band of the Mavericks playing the regiment to camp; for the men were
route-marching with their baggage. The rippling column swung into the
level&mdash;carts behind it divided left and right, ran about like an ant-hill,
and ...
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But this is sorcery!&rdquo; said the lama.
</p>

<p>
The plain dotted itself with tents that seemed to rise, all spread, from the
carts. Another rush of men invaded the grove, pitched a huge tent in silence,
ran up yet eight or nine more by the side of it, unearthed cooking-pots, pans,
and bundles, which were taken possession of by a crowd of native servants; and
behold the mango-tope turned into an orderly town as they watched!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; said the lama, sinking back afraid, as the fires
twinkled and white officers with jingling swords stalked into the Mess-tent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand back in the shadow. No one can see beyond the light of a
fire,&rdquo; said Kim, his eyes still on the flag. He had never before watched
the routine of a seasoned regiment pitching camp in thirty minutes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look! look! look!&rdquo; clucked the lama. &ldquo;Yonder comes a
priest.&rdquo; It was Bennett, the Church of England Chaplain of the regiment,
limping in dusty black. One of his flock had made some rude remarks about the
Chaplain&rsquo;s mettle; and to abash him Bennett had marched step by step with
the men that day. The black dress, gold cross on the watch-chain, the hairless
face, and the soft, black wideawake hat would have marked him as a holy man
anywhere in all India. He dropped into a camp-chair by the door of the
Mess-tent and slid off his boots. Three or four officers gathered round him,
laughing and joking over his exploit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The talk of white men is wholly lacking in dignity,&rdquo; said the
lama, who judged only by tone. &ldquo;But I considered the countenance of that
priest and I think he is learned. Is it likely that he will understand our
talk? I would talk to him of my Search.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never speak to a white man till he is fed,&rdquo; said Kim, quoting a
well-known proverb. &ldquo;They will eat now, and&mdash;and I do not think they
are good to beg from. Let us go back to the resting-place. After we have eaten
we will come again. It certainly was a Red Bull&mdash;<i>my</i> Red
Bull.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were both noticeably absent-minded when the old lady&rsquo;s retinue set
their meal before them; so none broke their reserve, for it is not lucky to
annoy guests.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Kim, picking his teeth, &ldquo;we will return to that
place; but thou, O Holy One, must wait a little way off, because thy feet are
heavier than mine and I am anxious to see more of that Red Bull.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how canst thou understand the talk? Walk slowly. The road is
dark,&rdquo; the lama replied uneasily.
</p>

<p>
Kim put the question aside. &ldquo;I marked a place near to the trees,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;where thou canst sit till I call. Nay,&rdquo; as the lama made
some sort of protest, &ldquo;remember this is <i>my</i> Search&mdash;the Search
for my Red Bull. The sign in the Stars was not for thee. I know a little of the
customs of white soldiers, and I always desire to see some new things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What dost thou not know of this world?&rdquo; The lama squatted
obediently in a little hollow of the ground not a hundred yards from the hump
of the mango-trees dark against the star-powdered sky.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stay till I call.&rdquo; Kim flitted into the dusk. He knew that in all
probability there would be sentries round the camp, and smiled to himself as he
heard the thick boots of one. A boy who can dodge over the roofs of Lahore city
on a moonlight night, using every little patch and corner of darkness to
discomfit his pursuer, is not likely to be checked by a line of well-trained
soldiers. He paid them the compliment of crawling between a couple, and,
running and halting, crouching and dropping flat, worked his way toward the
lighted Mess-tent where, close pressed behind the mango-tree, he waited till
some chance word should give him a returnable lead.
</p>

<p>
The one thing now in his mind was further information as to the Red Bull. For
aught he knew, and Kim&rsquo;s limitations were as curious and sudden as his
expansions, the men, the nine hundred thorough devils of his father&rsquo;s
prophecy, might pray to the beast after dark, as Hindus pray to the Holy Cow.
That at least would be entirely right and logical, and the padre with the gold
cross would be therefore the man to consult in the matter. On the other hand,
remembering sober-faced padres whom he had avoided in Lahore city, the priest
might be an inquisitive nuisance who would bid him learn. But had it not been
proven at Umballa that his sign in the high heavens portended War and armed
men? Was he not the Friend of the Stars as well as of all the World, crammed to
the teeth with dreadful secrets? Lastly&mdash;and firstly as the undercurrent
of all his quick thoughts&mdash;this adventure, though he did not know the
English word, was a stupendous lark&mdash;a delightful continuation of his old
flights across the housetops, as well as the fulfilment of sublime prophecy. He
lay belly-flat and wriggled towards the Mess-tent door, a hand on the amulet
round his neck.
</p>

<p>
It was as he suspected. The Sahibs prayed to their God; for in the centre of
the Mess-table&mdash;its sole ornament when they were on the line of
march&mdash;stood a golden bull fashioned from old-time loot of the Summer
Palace at Pekin&mdash;a red-gold bull with lowered head, ramping upon a field
of Irish green. To him the Sahibs held out their glasses and cried aloud
confusedly.
</p>

<p>
Now the Reverend Arthur Bennett always left Mess after that toast, and being
rather tired by his march his movements were more abrupt than usual. Kim, with
slightly raised head, was still staring at his totem on the table, when the
Chaplain stepped on his right shoulder-blade. Kim flinched under the leather,
and, rolling sideways, brought down the Chaplain, who, ever a man of action,
caught him by the throat and nearly choked the life out of him. Kim then kicked
him desperately in the stomach. Mr Bennett gasped and doubled up, but without
relaxing his grip, rolled over again, and silently hauled Kim to his own tent.
The Mavericks were incurable practical jokers; and it occurred to the
Englishman that silence was best till he had made complete inquiry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a boy!&rdquo; he said, as he drew his prize under the
light of the tent-pole lantern, then shaking him severely cried: &ldquo;What
were you doing? You&rsquo;re a thief. <i>Choor? Mallum?</i>&rdquo; His
Hindustanee was very limited, and the ruffled and disgusted Kim intended to
keep to the character laid down for him. As he recovered his breath he was
inventing a beautifully plausible tale of his relations to some scullion, and
at the same time keeping a keen eye on and a little under the Chaplain&rsquo;s
left arm-pit. The chance came; he ducked for the doorway, but a long arm shot
out and clutched at his neck, snapping the amulet-string and closing on the
amulet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give it me. O, give it me. Is it lost? Give me the papers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The words were in English&mdash;the tinny, saw-cut English of the native-bred,
and the Chaplain jumped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A scapular,&rdquo; said he, opening his hand. &ldquo;No, some sort of
heathen charm. Why&mdash;why, do you speak English? Little boys who steal are
beaten. You know that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not&mdash;I did not steal.&rdquo; Kim danced in agony like a
terrier at a lifted stick. &ldquo;Oh, give it me. It is my charm. Do not thieve
it from me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Chaplain took no heed, but, going to the tent door, called aloud. A
fattish, clean-shaven man appeared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want your advice, Father Victor,&rdquo; said Bennett. &ldquo;I found
this boy in the dark outside the Mess-tent. Ordinarily, I should have chastised
him and let him go, because I believe him to be a thief. But it seems he talks
English, and he attaches some sort of value to a charm round his neck. I
thought perhaps you might help me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Between himself and the Roman Catholic Chaplain of the Irish contingent lay, as
Bennett believed, an unbridgeable gulf, but it was noticeable that whenever the
Church of England dealt with a human problem she was very likely to call in the
Church of Rome. Bennett&rsquo;s official abhorrence of the Scarlet Woman and
all her ways was only equalled by his private respect for Father Victor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A thief talking English, is it? Let&rsquo;s look at his charm. No,
it&rsquo;s not a scapular, Bennett.&rdquo; He held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But have we any right to open it? A sound whipping&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did <i>not</i> thieve,&rdquo; protested Kim. &ldquo;You have hit me
kicks all over my body. Now give me my charm and I will go away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not quite so fast. We&rsquo;ll look first,&rdquo; said Father Victor,
leisurely rolling out poor Kimball O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>ne
varietur</i>&rdquo; parchment, his clearance-certificate, and Kim&rsquo;s
baptismal certificate. On this last O&rsquo;Hara&mdash;with some confused idea
that he was doing wonders for his son&mdash;had scrawled scores of times:
&ldquo;<i>Look after the boy. Please look after the
boy</i>&rdquo;&mdash;signing his name and regimental number in full.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Powers of Darkness below!&rdquo; said Father Victor, passing all over to
Mr Bennett. &ldquo;Do you know what these things are?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;They are mine, and I want to go
away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not quite understand,&rdquo; said Mr Bennett. &ldquo;He probably
brought them on purpose. It may be a begging trick of some kind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never saw a beggar less anxious to stay with his company, then.
There&rsquo;s the makings of a gay mystery here. Ye believe in Providence,
Bennett?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I believe in miracles, so it comes to the same thing. Powers of
Darkness! Kimball O&rsquo;Hara! And his son! But then he&rsquo;s a native, and
I saw Kimball married myself to Annie Shott. How long have you had these
things, boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ever since I was a little baby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Father Victor stepped forward quickly and opened the front of Kim&rsquo;s upper
garment. &ldquo;You see, Bennett, he&rsquo;s not very black. What&rsquo;s your
name?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kim.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or Kimball?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps. Will you let me go away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They call me Kim Rishti ke. That is Kim of the Rishti.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that&mdash;&lsquo;Rishti&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Eye</i>-rishti&mdash;that was the Regiment&mdash;my
father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Irish&mdash;oh, I see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yess. That was how my father told me. My father, he has lived.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has lived where?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has lived. Of <i>course</i> he is dead&mdash;gone-out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s your abrupt way of putting it, is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bennett interrupted. &ldquo;It is possible I have done the boy an injustice. He
is certainly white, though evidently neglected. I am sure I must have bruised
him. I do not think spirits&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get him a glass of sherry, then, and let him squat on the cot. Now,
Kim,&rdquo; continued Father Victor, &ldquo;no one is going to hurt you. Drink
that down and tell us about yourself. The truth, if you&rsquo;ve no
objection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim coughed a little as he put down the empty glass, and considered. This
seemed a time for caution and fancy. Small boys who prowl about camps are
generally turned out after a whipping. But he had received no stripes; the
amulet was evidently working in his favour, and it looked as though the Umballa
horoscope and the few words that he could remember of his father&rsquo;s
maunderings fitted in most miraculously. Else why did the fat padre seem so
impressed, and why the glass of hot yellow drink from the lean one?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My father, he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little. The woman,
she kept <i>kabarri</i> shop near where the hire-carriages are.&rdquo; Kim
began with a plunge, not quite sure how far the truth would serve him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>No!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;with a gesture of disgust. &ldquo;She went out
when I was born. My father, he got these papers from the Jadoo-Gher what do you
call that?&rdquo; (Bennett nodded) &ldquo;because he was in good-standing. What
do you call that?&rdquo; (again Bennett nodded). &ldquo;My father told me that.
He said, too, and also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa
two days ago, <i>he</i> said, that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field and
that the Bull shall help me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A phenomenal little liar,&rdquo; muttered Bennett.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Powers of Darkness below, what a country!&rdquo; murmured Father Victor.
&ldquo;Go on, Kim.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did <i>not</i> thieve. Besides, I am just now disciple of a very holy
man. He is sitting outside. We saw two men come with flags, making the place
ready. That is <i>always</i> so in a dream, or on account of
a&mdash;a&mdash;prophecy. So I knew it was come true. I saw the Red Bull on the
green field, and my father he said: &lsquo;Nine hundred <i>pukka</i> devils and
the Colonel riding on a horse will look after you when you find the Red
Bull!&rsquo; I did not know what to do when I saw the Bull, but I went away and
I came again when it was dark. I wanted to see the Bull again, and I saw the
Bull again with the&mdash;the Sahibs praying to it. I think the Bull shall help
me. The holy man said so too. He is sitting outside. Will you hurt him, if I
call him a shout now? He is very holy. He can witness to all the things I say,
and he knows I am not a thief.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sahibs praying to a bull!&rsquo; What in the world do you make of
that?&rdquo; said Bennett. &ldquo;&lsquo;Disciple of a holy man!&rsquo; Is the
boy mad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s boy, sure enough. O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s
boy leagued with all the Powers of Darkness. It&rsquo;s very much what his
father would have done if he was drunk. We&rsquo;d better invite the holy man.
He may know something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He does not know anything,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;I will show you him
if you come. He is my master. Then afterwards we can go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Powers of Darkness!&rdquo; was all that Father Victor could say, as
Bennett marched off, with a firm hand on Kim&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
They found the lama where he had dropped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Search is at an end for me,&rdquo; shouted Kim in the vernacular.
&ldquo;I have found the Bull, but God knows what comes next. They will not hurt
you. Come to the fat priest&rsquo;s tent with this thin man and see the end. It
is all new, and they cannot talk Hindi. They are only uncurried donkeys.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then it is not well to make a jest of their ignorance,&rdquo; the lama
returned. &ldquo;I am glad if thou art rejoiced, <i>chela</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dignified and unsuspicious, he strode into the little tent, saluted the
Churches as a Churchman, and sat down by the open charcoal brazier. The yellow
lining of the tent reflected in the lamplight made his face red-gold.
</p>

<p>
Bennett looked at him with the triple-ringed uninterest of the creed that lumps
nine-tenths of the world under the title of &ldquo;heathen&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what was the end of the Search? What gift has the Red Bull
brought?&rdquo; The lama addressed himself to Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says, &lsquo;What are you going to do?&rsquo;&rdquo; Bennett was
staring uneasily at Father Victor, and Kim, for his own ends, took upon himself
the office of interpreter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not see what concern this <i>faquir</i> has with the boy, who is
probably his dupe or his confederate,&rdquo; Bennett began. &ldquo;We cannot
allow an English boy&mdash;Assuming that he is the son of a Mason, the sooner
he goes to the Masonic Orphanage the better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! That&rsquo;s your opinion as Secretary to the Regimental
Lodge,&rdquo; said Father Victor; &ldquo;but we might as well tell the old man
what we are going to do. He doesn&rsquo;t look like a villain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My experience is that one can never fathom the Oriental mind. Now,
Kimball, I wish you to tell this man what I say word for word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim gathered the import of the next few sentences and began thus:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Holy One, the thin fool who looks like a camel says that I am the son of
a Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it is true. I knew it since my birth, but <i>he</i> could only find
it out by rending the amulet from my neck and reading all the papers. He thinks
that once a Sahib is always a Sahib, and between the two of them they purpose
to keep me in this Regiment or to send me to a <i>madrissah</i> (a school). It
has happened before. I have always avoided it. The fat fool is of one mind and
the camel-like one of another. But that is no odds. I may spend one night here
and perhaps the next. It has happened before. Then I will run away and return
to thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But tell them that thou art my <i>chela</i>. Tell them how thou didst
come to me when I was faint and bewildered. Tell them of our Search, and they
will surely let thee go now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have already told them. They laugh, and they talk of the
police.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; asked Mr Bennett.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah. He only says that if you do not let me go it will stop him in his
business&mdash;his ur-gent private af-fairs.&rdquo; This last was a
reminiscence of some talk with a Eurasian clerk in the Canal Department, but it
only drew a smile, which nettled him. &ldquo;And if you <i>did</i> know what
his business was you would not be in such a beastly hurry to interfere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo; said Father Victor, not without feeling, as he
watched the lama&rsquo;s face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is a River in this country which he wishes to find so verree much.
It was put out by an Arrow which&mdash;&rdquo; Kim tapped his foot impatiently
as he translated in his own mind from the vernacular to his clumsy English.
&ldquo;Oah, it was made by our Lord God Buddha, you know, and if you wash there
you are washed away from all your sins and made as white as cotton-wool.&rdquo;
(Kim had heard mission-talk in his time.) &ldquo;I am his disciple, and we
<i>must</i> find that River. It is so verree valuable to us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say that again,&rdquo; said Bennett. Kim obeyed, with amplifications.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But this is gross blasphemy!&rdquo; cried the Church of England.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tck! Tck!&rdquo; said Father Victor sympathetically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
give a good deal to be able to talk the vernacular. A river that washes away
sin! And how long have you two been looking for it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, many days. Now we wish to go away and look for it again. It is not
here, you see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Father Victor gravely. &ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t go
on in that old man&rsquo;s company. It would be different, Kim, if you were not
a soldier&rsquo;s son. Tell him that the Regiment will take care of you and
make you as good a man as your&mdash;as good a man as can be. Tell him that if
he believes in miracles he must believe that&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no need to play on his credulity,&rdquo; Bennett interrupted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing no such thing. He must believe that the boy&rsquo;s
coming here&mdash;to his own Regiment&mdash;in search of his Red Bull is in the
nature of a miracle. Consider the chances against it, Bennett. This one boy in
all India, and our Regiment of all others on the line o&rsquo; march for him to
meet with! It&rsquo;s predestined on the face of it. Yes, tell him it&rsquo;s
<i>Kismet. Kismet, mallum?</i> (Do you understand?)&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned towards the lama, to whom he might as well have talked of
Mesopotamia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They say,&rdquo;&mdash;the old man&rsquo;s eye lighted at Kim&rsquo;s
speech &ldquo;they say that the meaning of my horoscope is now accomplished,
and that being led back&mdash;though as thou knowest I went out of
curiosity&mdash;to these people and their Red Bull I must needs go to a
<i>madrissah</i> and be turned into a Sahib. Now I make pretence of agreement,
for at the worst it will be but a few meals eaten away from thee. Then I will
slip away and follow down the road to Saharunpore. Therefore, Holy One, keep
with that Kulu woman&mdash;on no account stray far from her cart till I come
again. Past question, my sign is of War and of armed men. See how they have
given me wine to drink and set me upon a bed of honour! My father must have
been some great person. So if they raise me to honour among them, good. If not,
good again. However it goes, I will run back to thee when I am tired. But stay
with the Rajputni, or I shall miss thy feet ... Oah yess,&rdquo; said the boy,
&ldquo;I have told him everything you tell me to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I cannot see any need why he should wait,&rdquo; said Bennett,
feeling in his trouser-pocket. &ldquo;We can investigate the details
later&mdash;and I will give him a ru&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give him time. Maybe he&rsquo;s fond of the lad,&rdquo; said Father
Victor, half arresting the clergyman&rsquo;s motion.
</p>

<p>
The lama dragged forth his rosary and pulled his huge hat-brim over his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can he want now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says&rdquo;&mdash;Kim put up one hand. &ldquo;He says: &lsquo;Be
quiet.&rsquo; He wants to speak to me by himself. You see, you do not know one
little word of what he says, and I think if you talk he will perhaps give you
very bad curses. When he takes those beads like that, you see, he always wants
to be quiet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two Englishmen sat overwhelmed, but there was a look in Bennett&rsquo;s eye
that promised ill for Kim when he should be relaxed to the religious arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A Sahib and the son of a Sahib&mdash;&rdquo; The lama&rsquo;s voice was
harsh with pain. &ldquo;But no white man knows the land and the customs of the
land as thou knowest. How comes it this is true?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What matter, Holy One?&mdash;but remember it is only for a night or two.
Remember, I can change swiftly. It will all be as it was when I first spoke to
thee under Zam-Zammah the great gun&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As a boy in the dress of white men&mdash;when I first went to the Wonder
House. And a second time thou wast a Hindu. What shall the third incarnation
be?&rdquo; He chuckled drearily. &ldquo;Ah, <i>chela</i>, thou has done a wrong
to an old man because my heart went out to thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And mine to thee. But how could I know that the Red Bull would bring me
to this business?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama covered his face afresh, and nervously rattled the rosary. Kim
squatted beside him and laid hold upon a fold of his clothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now it is understood that the boy is a Sahib?&rdquo; he went on in a
muffled tone. &ldquo;Such a Sahib as was he who kept the images in the Wonder
House.&rdquo; The lama&rsquo;s experience of white men was limited. He seemed
to be repeating a lesson. &ldquo;So then it is not seemly that he should do
other than as the Sahibs do. He must go back to his own people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For a day and a night and a day,&rdquo; Kim pleaded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, ye don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Father Victor saw Kim edging towards the
door, and interposed a strong leg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not understand the customs of white men. The Priest of the Images
in the Wonder House in Lahore was more courteous than the thin one here. This
boy will be taken from me. They will make a Sahib of my disciple? Woe to me!
How shall I find my River? Have <i>they</i> no disciples? Ask.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says he is very sorree that he cannot find the River now any more. He
says, Why have you no disciples, and stop bothering him? He wants to be washed
of his sins.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Neither Bennett nor Father Victor found any answer ready.
</p>

<p>
Said Kim in English, distressed for the lama&rsquo;s agony: &ldquo;I think if
you will let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal. We will look
for that River like before I was caught. I wish I did not come here to find the
Red Bull and all that sort of thing. I do not want it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very best day&rsquo;s work you ever did for yourself,
young man,&rdquo; said Bennett.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens, I don&rsquo;t know how to console him,&rdquo; said Father
Victor, watching the lama intently. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t take the boy away
with him, and yet he&rsquo;s a good man&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a good
man. Bennett, if you give him that rupee he&rsquo;ll curse you root and
branch!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They listened to each other&rsquo;s breathing&mdash;three&mdash;five full
minutes. Then the lama raised his head, and looked forth across them into space
and emptiness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I am a Follower of the Way,&rdquo; he said bitterly. &ldquo;The sin
is mine and the punishment is mine. I made believe to myself for now I see it
was but make-belief&mdash;that thou wast sent to me to aid in the Search. So my
heart went out to thee for thy charity and thy courtesy and the wisdom of thy
little years. But those who follow the Way must permit not the fire of any
desire or attachment, for that is all Illusion. As says ...&rdquo; He quoted an
old, old Chinese text, backed it with another, and reinforced these with a
third. &ldquo;I stepped aside from the Way, my <i>chela</i>. It was no fault of
thine. I delighted in the sight of life, the new people upon the roads, and in
thy joy at seeing these things. I was pleased with thee who should have
considered my Search and my Search alone. Now I am sorrowful because thou art
taken away and my River is far from me. It is the Law which I have
broken!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Powers of Darkness below!&rdquo; said Father Victor, who, wise in the
confessional, heard the pain in every sentence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see now that the sign of the Red Bull was a sign for me as well as for
thee. All Desire is red&mdash;and evil. I will do penance and find my River
alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At least go back to the Kulu woman,&rdquo; said Kim, &ldquo;otherwise
thou wilt be lost upon the roads. She will feed thee till I run back to
thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama waved a hand to show that the matter was finally settled in his mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;&mdash;his tone altered as he turned to
Kim,&mdash;&ldquo;what will they do with thee? At least I may, acquiring merit,
wipe out past ill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make me a Sahib&mdash;so they think. The day after tomorrow I return. Do
not grieve.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of what sort? Such an one as this or that man?&rdquo; He pointed to
Father Victor. &ldquo;Such an one as those I saw this evening, men wearing
swords and stamping heavily?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is not well. These men follow desire and come to emptiness. Thou
must not be of their sort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Umballa priest said that my Star was War,&rdquo; Kim interjected.
&ldquo;I will ask these fools&mdash;but there is truly no need. I will run away
this night, for all I wanted to see the new things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim put two or three questions in English to Father Victor, translating the
replies to the lama.
</p>

<p>
Then: &ldquo;He says, &lsquo;You take him from me and you cannot say what you
will make him.&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;Tell me before I go, for it is not a
small thing to make a child.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will be sent to a school. Later on, we shall see. Kimball, I suppose
you&rsquo;d like to be a soldier?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Gorah-log</i> (white-folk). No-ah! No-ah!&rdquo; Kim shook his head
violently. There was nothing in his composition to which drill and routine
appealed. &ldquo;I will not be a soldier.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will be what you&rsquo;re told to be,&rdquo; said Bennett;
&ldquo;and you should be grateful that we&rsquo;re going to help you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim smiled compassionately. If these men lay under the delusion that he would
do anything that he did not fancy, so much the better.
</p>

<p>
Another long silence followed. Bennett fidgeted with impatience, and suggested
calling a sentry to evict the <i>faquir</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do they give or sell learning among the Sahibs? Ask them,&rdquo; said
the lama, and Kim interpreted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They say that money is paid to the teacher&mdash;but that money the
Regiment will give ... What need? It is only for a night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And&mdash;the more money is paid the better learning is given?&rdquo;
The lama disregarded Kim&rsquo;s plans for an early flight. &ldquo;It is no
wrong to pay for learning. To help the ignorant to wisdom is always a
merit.&rdquo; The rosary clicked furiously as an abacus. Then he faced his
oppressors.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ask them for how much money do they give a wise and suitable teaching?
And in what city is that teaching given?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Father Victor in English, when Kim had translated,
&ldquo;that depends. The Regiment would pay for you all the time you are at the
Military Orphanage; or you might go on the Punjab Masonic Orphanage&rsquo;s
list (not that he or you &rsquo;ud understand what that means); but the best
schooling a boy can get in India is, of course, at St Xavier&rsquo;s in
Partibus at Lucknow.&rdquo; This took some time to interpret, for Bennett
wished to cut it short.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wants to know how much?&rdquo; said Kim placidly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Two or three hundred rupees a year.&rdquo; Father Victor was long past
any sense of amazement. Bennett, impatient, did not understand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says: &lsquo;Write that name and the money upon a paper and give it
him.&rsquo; And he says you must write your name below, because he is going to
write a letter in some days to you. He says you are a good man. He says the
other man is a fool. He is going away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama rose suddenly. &ldquo;I follow my Search,&rdquo; he cried, and was
gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll run slap into the sentries,&rdquo; cried Father Victor,
jumping up as the lama stalked out; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t leave the
boy.&rdquo; Kim made swift motion to follow, but checked himself. There was no
sound of challenge outside. The lama had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Kim settled himself composedly on the Chaplain&rsquo;s cot. At least the lama
had promised that he would stay with the Raiput woman from Kulu, and the rest
was of the smallest importance. It pleased him that the two padres were so
evidently excited. They talked long in undertones, Father Victor urging some
scheme on Mr Bennett, who seemed incredulous. All this was very new and
fascinating, but Kim felt sleepy. They called men into the tent&mdash;one of
them certainly was the Colonel, as his father had prophesied&mdash;and they
asked him an infinity of questions, chiefly about the woman who looked after
him, all of which Kim answered truthfully. They did not seem to think the woman
a good guardian.
</p>

<p>
After all, this was the newest of his experiences. Sooner or later, if he
chose, he could escape into great, grey, formless India, beyond tents and
padres and colonels. Meantime, if the Sahibs were to be impressed, he would do
his best to impress them. He too was a white man.
</p>

<p>
After much talk that he could not comprehend, they handed him over to a
sergeant, who had strict instructions not to let him escape. The Regiment would
go on to Umballa, and Kim would be sent up, partly at the expense of the Lodge
and in part by subscription, to a place called Sanawar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s miraculous past all whooping, Colonel,&rdquo; said Father
Victor, when he had talked without a break for ten minutes. &ldquo;His Buddhist
friend has levanted after taking my name and address. I can&rsquo;t quite make
out whether he&rsquo;ll pay for the boy&rsquo;s education or whether he is
preparing some sort of witchcraft on his own account.&rdquo; Then to Kim:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll live to be grateful to your friend the Red Bull yet.
We&rsquo;ll make a man of you at Sanawar&mdash;even at the price o&rsquo;
making you a Protestant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;most certainly,&rdquo; said Bennett.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you will not go to Sanawar,&rdquo; said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But we will go to Sanawar, little man. That&rsquo;s the order of the
Commander-in-Chief, who&rsquo;s a trifle more important than
O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will not go to Sanawar. You will go to thee War.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a shout of laughter from the full tent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When you know your own Regiment a trifle better you won&rsquo;t confuse
the line of march with line of battle, Kim. We hope to go to &lsquo;thee
War&rsquo; sometime.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah, I know all thatt.&rdquo; Kim drew his bow again at a venture. If
they were not going to the war, at least they did not know what he knew of the
talk in the veranda at Umballa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know you are not at thee war now; but I tell <i>you</i> that as soon
as you get to Umballa you will be sent to the war&mdash;the new war. It is a
war of eight thousand men, besides the guns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s explicit. D&rsquo;you add prophecy to your other gifts?
Take him along, sergeant. Take up a suit for him from the Drums, an&rsquo; take
care he doesn&rsquo;t slip through your fingers. Who says the age of miracles
is gone by? I think I&rsquo;ll go to bed. My poor mind&rsquo;s
weakening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At the far end of the camp, silent as a wild animal, an hour later sat Kim,
newly washed all over, in a horrible stiff suit that rasped his arms and legs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A most amazin&rsquo; young bird,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;He
turns up in charge of a yellow-headed buck-Brahmin priest, with his
father&rsquo;s Lodge certificates round his neck, talkin&rsquo; God knows what
all of a red bull. The buck-Brahmin evaporates without explanations, an&rsquo;
the bhoy sets cross-legged on the Chaplain&rsquo;s bed prophesyin&rsquo; bloody
war to the men at large. Injia&rsquo;s a wild land for a God-fearin&rsquo; man.
I&rsquo;ll just tie his leg to the tent-pole in case he&rsquo;ll go through the
roof. What did ye say about the war?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eight thousand men, besides guns,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;Very soon you
will see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a consolin&rsquo; little imp. Lie down between the Drums
an&rsquo; go to bye-bye. Those two boys will watch your slumbers.&rdquo;
</p>

<i>Song of Diego Valdez.</i>
</p>

<p>
Very early in the morning the white tents came down and disappeared as the
Mavericks took a side-road to Umballa. It did not skirt the resting-place, and
Kim, trudging beside a baggage-cart under fire of comments from soldiers&rsquo;
wives, was not so confident as overnight. He discovered that he was closely
watched&mdash;Father Victor on the one side, and Mr Bennett on the other.
</p>

<p>
In the forenoon the column checked. A camel-orderly handed the Colonel a
letter. He read it, and spoke to a Major. Half a mile in the rear, Kim heard a
hoarse and joyful clamour rolling down on him through the thick dust. Then
someone beat him on the back, crying: &ldquo;Tell us how ye knew, ye little
limb of Satan? Father dear, see if ye can make him tell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A pony ranged alongside, and he was hauled on to the priest&rsquo;s saddlebow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, my son, your prophecy of last night has come true. Our orders are
to entrain at Umballa for the Front tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is thatt?&rdquo; said Kim, for &ldquo;<i>front</i>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<i>entrain</i>&rdquo; were newish words to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are going to &lsquo;thee War,&rsquo; as you called it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you are going to thee War. I said last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye did; but, Powers o&rsquo; Darkness, how did ye know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. He shut his lips, nodded his head, and looked
unspeakable things. The Chaplain moved on through the dust, and privates,
sergeants, and subalterns called one another&rsquo;s attention to the boy. The
Colonel, at the head of the column, stared at him curiously. &ldquo;It was
probably some bazar rumour.&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but even then&mdash;&rdquo;
He referred to the paper in his hand. &ldquo;Hang it all, the thing was only
decided within the last forty-eight hours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are there many more like you in India?&rdquo; said Father Victor,
&ldquo;or are you by way o&rsquo; being a <i>lusus naturæ?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now I have told you,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;will you let me go back
to my old man? If he has not stayed with that woman from Kulu, I am afraid he
will die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By what I saw of him he&rsquo;s as well able to take care of himself as
you. No. Ye&rsquo;ve brought us luck, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to make
a man of you. I&rsquo;ll take ye back to your baggage-cart and ye&rsquo;ll come
to me this evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For the rest of the day Kim found himself an object of distinguished
consideration among a few hundred white men. The story of his appearance in
camp, the discovery of his parentage, and his prophecy, had lost nothing in the
telling. A big, shapeless white woman on a pile of bedding asked him
mysteriously whether he thought her husband would come back from the war. Kim
reflected gravely, and said that he would, and the woman gave him food. In many
respects, this big procession that played music at intervals&mdash;this crowd
that talked and laughed so easily&mdash;resembled a festival in Lahore city. So
far, there was no sign of hard work, and he resolved to lend the spectacle his
patronage. At evening there came out to meet them bands of music, and played
the Mavericks into camp near Umballa railway station. That was an interesting
night. Men of other regiments came to visit the Mavericks. The Mavericks went
visiting on their own account. Their pickets hurried forth to bring them back,
met pickets of strange regiments on the same duty; and, after a while, the
bugles blew madly for more pickets with officers to control the tumult. The
Mavericks had a reputation for liveliness to live up to. But they fell in on
the platform next morning in perfect shape and condition; and Kim, left behind
with the sick, women, and boys, found himself shouting farewells excitedly as
the trains drew away. Life as a Sahib was amusing so far; but he touched it
with a cautious hand. Then they marched him back in charge of a drummer-boy to
empty, lime-washed barracks, whose floors were covered with rubbish and string
and paper, and whose ceilings gave back his lonely footfall. Native-fashion, he
curled himself up on a stripped cot and went to sleep. An angry man stumped
down the veranda, woke him up, and said he was a schoolmaster. This was enough
for Kim, and he retired into his shell. He could just puzzle out the various
English Police notices in Lahore city, because they affected his comfort; and
among the many guests of the woman who looked after him had been a queer German
who painted scenery for the Parsee travelling theatre. He told Kim that he had
been &ldquo;on the barricades in &ldquo;Forty-eight,&rdquo; and
therefore&mdash;at least that was how it struck Kim&mdash;he would teach the
boy to write in return for food. Kim had been kicked as far as single letters,
but did not think well of them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know anything. Go away!&rdquo; said Kim, scenting evil.
Hereupon the man caught him by the ear, dragged him to a room in a far-off wing
where a dozen drummer-boys were sitting on forms, and told him to be still if
he could do nothing else. This he managed very successfully. The man explained
something or other with white lines on a black board for at least half an hour,
and Kim continued his interrupted nap. He much disapproved of the present
aspect of affairs, for this was the very school and discipline he had spent
two-thirds of his young life in avoiding. Suddenly a beautiful idea occurred to
him, and he wondered that he had not thought of it before.
</p>

<p>
The man dismissed them, and first to spring through the veranda into the open
sunshine was Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, you! &rsquo;Alt! Stop!&rdquo; said a high voice at his
heels. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to look after you. My orders are not to let you
out of my sight. Where are you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was the drummer-boy who had been hanging round him all the forenoon&mdash;a
fat and freckled person of about fourteen, and Kim loathed him from the soles
of his boots to his cap-ribbons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To the bazar&mdash;to get sweets&mdash;for you,&rdquo; said Kim, after
thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, the bazar&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; bounds. If we go there we&rsquo;ll
get a dressing-down. You come back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How near can we go?&rdquo; Kim did not know what bounds meant, but he
wished to be polite&mdash;for the present.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow near? &rsquo;Ow far, you mean! We can go as far as that tree
down the road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I will go there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s too &rsquo;ot. I can
watch you from &rsquo;ere. It&rsquo;s no good your runninv away. If you did,
they&rsquo;d spot you by your clothes. That&rsquo;s regimental stuff
you&rsquo;re wearin&rsquo;. There ain&rsquo;t a picket in Umballa
wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ead you back quicker than you started out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This did not impress Kim as much as the knowledge that his raiment would tire
him out if he tried to run. He slouched to the tree at the corner of a bare
road leading towards the bazar, and eyed the natives passing. Most of them were
barrack-servants of the lowest caste. Kim hailed a sweeper, who promptly
retorted with a piece of unnecessary insolence, in the natural belief that the
European boy could not follow it. The low, quick answer undeceived him. Kim put
his fettered soul into it, thankful for the late chance to abuse somebody in
the tongue he knew best. &ldquo;And now, go to the nearest letter-writer in the
bazar and tell him to come here. I would write a letter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;but what manner of white man&rsquo;s son art thou to need a
bazar letter-writer? Is there not a schoolmaster in the barracks?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay; and Hell is full of the same sort. Do my order, you&mdash;you Od!
Thy mother was married under a basket! Servant of Lal Beg&rdquo; (Kim knew the
God of the sweepers), &ldquo;run on my business or we will talk again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sweeper shuffled off in haste. &ldquo;There is a white boy by the barracks
waiting under a tree who is not a white boy,&rdquo; he stammered to the first
bazar letter-writer he came across. &ldquo;He needs thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will he pay?&rdquo; said the spruce scribe, gathering up his desk and
pens and sealing-wax all in order.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not know. He is not like other boys. Go and see. It is well
worth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim danced with impatience when the slim young Kayeth hove in sight. As soon as
his voice could carry he cursed him volubly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;First I will take my pay,&rdquo; the letter-writer said. &ldquo;Bad
words have made the price higher. But who art thou, dressed in that fashion, to
speak in this fashion?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha! That is in the letter which thou shalt write. Never was such a
tale. But I am in no haste. Another writer will serve me. Umballa city is as
full of them as is Lahore.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Four annas,&rdquo; said the writer, sitting down and spreading his cloth
in the shade of a deserted barrack-wing.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically Kim squatted beside him&mdash;squatted as only the natives
can&mdash;in spite of the abominable clinging trousers.
</p>

<p>
The writer regarded him sideways.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is the price to ask of Sahibs,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;Now fix me a
true one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An anna and a half. How do I know, having written the letter, that thou
wilt not run away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I must not go beyond this tree, and there is also the stamp to be
considered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I get no commission on the price of the stamp. Once more, what manner of
white boy art thou?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That shall be said in the letter, which is to Mahbub Ali, the
horse-dealer in the Kashmir Serai, at Lahore. He is my friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wonder on wonder!&rdquo; murmured the letter-writer, dipping a reed in
the inkstand. &ldquo;To be written in Hindi?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Assuredly. To Mahbub Ali then. Begin! <i>I have come down with the old
man as far as Umballa in the train. At Umballa I carried the news of the bay
mare&rsquo;s pedigree.</i>&rdquo; After what he had seen in the garden, he was
not going to write of white stallions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Slower a little. What has a bay mare to do ... Is it Mahbub Ali, the
great dealer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who else? I have been in his service. Take more ink. Again. <i>As the
order was, so I did it. We then went on foot towards Benares, but on the third
day we found a certain regiment.</i> Is that down?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, <i>pulton</i>,&rdquo; murmured the writer, all ears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I went into their camp and was caught, and by means of the charm
about my neck, which thou knowest, it was established that I was the son of
some man in the regiment: according to the prophecy of the Red Bull, which thou
knowest was common talk of our bazar.</i>&rdquo; Kim waited for this shaft to
sink into the letter-writer&rsquo;s heart, cleared his throat, and continued:
&ldquo;<i>A priest clothed me and gave me a new name ... One priest, however,
was a fool. The clothes are very heavy, but I am a Sahib and my heart is heavy
too. They send me to a school and beat me. I do not like the air and water
here. Come then and help me, Mahbub Ali, or send me some money, for I have not
sufficient to pay the writer who writes this.</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Who writes this.&rsquo; It is my own fault that I was tricked.
Thou art as clever as Husain Bux that forged the Treasury stamps at Nucklao.
But what a tale! What a tale! Is it true by any chance?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It does not profit to tell lies to Mahbub Ali. It is better to help his
friends by lending them a stamp. When the money comes I will repay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The writer grunted doubtfully, but took a stamp out of his desk, sealed the
letter, handed it over to Kim, and departed. Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s was a name of
power in Umballa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is the way to win a good account with the Gods,&rdquo; Kim shouted
after him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pay me twice over when the money comes,&rdquo; the man cried over his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was you bukkin&rsquo; to that nigger about?&rdquo; said the
drummer-boy when Kim returned to the veranda. &ldquo;I was watch-in&rsquo;
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was only talkin&rsquo; to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You talk the same as a nigger, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No-ah! No-ah! I onlee speak a little. What shall we do now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The bugles&rsquo;ll go for dinner in arf a minute. My Gawd! I wish
I&rsquo;d gone up to the Front with the Regiment. It&rsquo;s awful doin&rsquo;
nothin&rsquo; but school down &rsquo;ere. Don&rsquo;t you &rsquo;ate it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah yess!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;d run away if I knew where to go to, but, as the men say, in this
bloomin&rsquo; Injia you&rsquo;re only a prisoner at large. You can&rsquo;t
desert without bein&rsquo; took back at once. I&rsquo;m fair sick of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have been in Be&mdash;England?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, I only come out last troopin&rsquo; season with my mother. I
should think I &rsquo;ave been in England. What a ignorant little beggar you
are! You was brought up in the gutter, wasn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah yess. Tell me something about England. My father he came from
there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Though he would not say so, Kim of course disbelieved every word the
drummer-boy spoke about the Liverpool suburb which was his England. It passed
the heavy time till dinner&mdash;a most unappetizing meal served to the boys
and a few invalids in a corner of a barrack-room. But that he had written to
Mahbub Ali, Kim would have been almost depressed. The indifference of native
crowds he was used to; but this strong loneliness among white men preyed on
him. He was grateful when, in the course of the afternoon, a big soldier took
him over to Father Victor, who lived in another wing across another dusty
parade-ground. The priest was reading an English letter written in purple ink.
He looked at Kim more curiously than ever.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; how do you like it, my son, as far as you&rsquo;ve gone? Not
much, eh? It must be hard&mdash;very hard on a wild animal. Listen now.
I&rsquo;ve an amazin&rsquo; epistle from your friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is he? Is he well? Oah! If he knows to write me letters, it is all
right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fond of him then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Of</i> course I am fond of him. He was fond of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems so by the look of this. He can&rsquo;t write English, can
he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah no. Not that I know, but <i>of</i> course he found a letter-writer
who can write English verree well, and so he wrote. I do hope you
understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That accounts for it. D&rsquo;you know anything about his money
affairs?&rdquo; Kim&rsquo;s face showed that he did not.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo;. Now listen if you can make
head or tail o&rsquo; this. We&rsquo;ll skip the first part ... It&rsquo;s
written from Jagadhir Road ... &lsquo;<i>Sitting on wayside in grave

crown of his head, but going to Benares by train on account of persecution of
old woman talking so much and unanxious residing Saharunpore in any domestic
capacity.</i>&rsquo; Now what in the world does that mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has asked him to be her <i>puro</i>&mdash;her clergyman&mdash;at
Saharunpore, <i>I</i> think. He would not do that on account of his River. She
<i>did</i> talk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear to you, is it? It beats me altogether. &lsquo;<i>So
going to Benares, where will find address and forward rupees for boy who is
apple of eye, and for Almighty God&rsquo;s sake execute this education, and

be sent per hoondi three hundred per annum. For God Almighty&rsquo;s
sake.</i>&rsquo; Now, is that ravin&rsquo; lunacy or a business proposition? I
ask you, because I&rsquo;m fairly at my wits&rsquo; end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says he will give me three hundred rupees a year? So he will give me
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the way you look at it, is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Of</i> course. If he says so!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The priest whistled; then he addressed Kim as an equal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe it; but we&rsquo;ll see. You were goin&rsquo; off today to the Military
Orphanage at Sanawar, where the Regiment would keep you till you were old
enough to enlist. Ye&rsquo;d be brought up to the Church of England. Bennett
arranged for that. On the other hand, if ye go to St Xavier&rsquo;s ye&rsquo;ll
get a better education an&mdash;an can have the religion. D&rsquo;ye see my
dilemma? Kim saw nothing save a vision of the lama going south in a train with
none to beg for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like most people, I&rsquo;m going to temporize. If your friend sends the
money from Benares&mdash;Powers of Darkness below, where&rsquo;s a
street-beggar to raise three hundred rupees?&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll go down to
Lucknow and I&rsquo;ll pay your fare, because I can&rsquo;t touch the
subscription-money if I intend, as I do, to make ye a Catholic. If he
doesn&rsquo;t, ye&rsquo;ll go to the Military Orphanage at the Regiment&rsquo;s
expense. I&rsquo;ll allow him three days&rsquo; grace, though I don&rsquo;t
believe it at all. Even then, if he fails in his payments later on ... but
it&rsquo;s beyond me. We can only walk one step at a time in this world, praise
God! An&rsquo; they sent Bennett to the Front an&rsquo; left me behind. Bennett
can&rsquo;t expect everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah yess,&rdquo; said Kim vaguely.
</p>

<p>
The priest leaned forward. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a month&rsquo;s pay to find
what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on inside that little round head of yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; said Kim, and scratched it. He was wondering
whether Mahbub Ali would send him as much as a whole rupee. Then he could pay
the letter-writer and write letters to the lama at Benares. Perhaps Mahbub Ali
would visit him next time he came south with horses. Surely he must know that
Kim&rsquo;s delivery of the letter to the officer at Umballa had caused the
great war which the men and boys had discussed so loudly over the barrack
dinner-tables. But if Mahbub Ali did not know this, it would be very unsafe to
tell him so. Mahbub Ali was hard upon boys who knew, or thought they knew, too
much.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, till I get further news&rdquo;&mdash;Father Victor&rsquo;s voice
interrupted the reverie. &ldquo;Ye can run along now and play with the other
boys. They&rsquo;ll teach ye something&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t think
ye&rsquo;ll like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The day dragged to its weary end. When he wished to sleep he was instructed how
to fold up his clothes and set out his boots; the other boys deriding. Bugles
waked him in the dawn; the schoolmaster caught him after breakfast, thrust a
page of meaningless characters under his nose, gave them senseless names and
whacked him without reason. Kim meditated poisoning him with opium borrowed
from a barrack-sweeper, but reflected that, as they all ate at one table in
public (this was peculiarly revolting to Kim, who preferred to turn his back on
the world at meals), the stroke might be dangerous. Then he attempted running
off to the village where the priest had tried to drug the lama&mdash;the
village where the old soldier lived. But far-seeing sentries at every exit
headed back the little scarlet figure. Trousers and jacket crippled body and
mind alike so he abandoned the project and fell back, Oriental-fashion, on time
and chance. Three days of torment passed in the big, echoing white rooms. He
walked out of afternoons under escort of the drummer-boy, and all he heard from
his companions were the few useless words which seemed to make two-thirds of
the white man&rsquo;s abuse. Kim knew and despised them all long ago. The boy
resented his silence and lack of interest by beating him, as was only natural.
He did not care for any of the bazars which were in bounds. He styled all
natives &ldquo;niggers&rdquo;; yet servants and sweepers called him abominable
names to his face, and, misled by their deferential attitude, he never
understood. This somewhat consoled Kim for the beatings.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the fourth day a judgement overtook that drummer. They had
gone out together towards Umballa racecourse. He returned alone, weeping, with
news that young O&rsquo;Hara, to whom he had been doing nothing in particular,
had hailed a scarlet-bearded nigger on horseback; that the nigger had then and
there laid into him with a peculiarly adhesive quirt, picked up young
O&rsquo;Hara, and borne him off at full gallop. These tidings came to Father
Victor, and he drew down his long upper lip. He was already sufficiently
startled by a letter from the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares, enclosing a
native banker&rsquo;s note of hand for three hundred rupees, and an amazing
prayer to &ldquo;Almighty God&rdquo;. The lama would have been more annoyed
than the priest had he known how the bazar letter-writer had translated his
phrase &ldquo;to acquire merit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Powers of Darkness below!&rdquo; Father Victor fumbled with the note.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; now he&rsquo;s off with another of his peep-o&rsquo;-day
friends. I don&rsquo;t know whether it will be a greater relief to me to get
him back or to have him lost. He&rsquo;s beyond my comprehension. How the
Divil&mdash;yes, he&rsquo;s the man I mean&mdash;can a street-beggar raise
money to educate white boys?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Three miles off, on Umballa racecourse, Mahbub Ali, reining a grey Kabuli
stallion with Kim in front of him, was saying:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Little Friend of all the World, there is <i>my</i> honour and
reputation to be considered. All the officer-Sahibs in all the regiments, and
all Umballa, know Mahbub Ali. Men saw me pick thee up and chastise that boy. We
are seen now from far across this plain. How can I take thee away, or account
for thy disappearing if I set thee down and let thee run off into the crops?
They would put me in jail. Be patient. Once a Sahib, always a Sahib. When thou
art a man&mdash;who knows?&mdash;thou wilt be grateful to Mahbub Ali.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take me beyond their sentries where I can change this red. Give me money
and I will go to Benares and be with my lama again. I do not want to be a
Sahib, and remember I did deliver that message.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The stallion bounded wildly. Mahbub Ali had incautiously driven home the
sharp-edged stirrup. (He was not the new sort of fluent horse-dealer who wears
English boots and spurs.) Kim drew his own conclusions from that betrayal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was a small matter. It lay on the straight road to Benares. I and
the Sahib have by this time forgotten it. I send so many letters and messages
to men who ask questions about horses, I cannot well remember one from the
other. Was it some matter of a bay mare that Peters Sahib wished the pedigree
of?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim saw the trap at once. If he had said &ldquo;bay mare&rdquo; Mahbub would
have known by his very readiness to fall in with the amendment that the boy
suspected something. Kim replied therefore:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bay mare. No. <i>I</i> do not forget my messages thus. It was a white
stallion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, so it was. A white Arab stallion. But thou didst write &lsquo;bay
mare&rsquo; to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who cares to tell truth to a letter-writer?&rdquo; Kim answered, feeling
Mahbub&rsquo;s palm on his heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hi! Mahbub, you old villain, pull up!&rdquo; cried a voice, and an
Englishman raced alongside on a little polo-pony. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
chasing you half over the country. That Kabuli of yours can go. For sale, I
suppose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have some young stuff coming on made by Heaven for the delicate and
difficult polo-game. He has no equal. He&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Plays polo and waits at table. Yes. We know all that. What the deuce
have you got there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A. boy,&rdquo; said Mahbub gravely. &ldquo;He was being beaten by
another boy. His father was once a white soldier in the big war. The boy was a
child in Lahore city. He played with my horses when he was a babe. Now I think
they will make him a soldier. He has been newly caught by his father&rsquo;s
Regiment that went up to the war last week. But I do not think he wants to be a
soldier. I take him for a ride. Tell me where thy barracks are and I will set
thee there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me go. I can find the barracks alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if thou runnest away who will say it is not my fault?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll run back to his dinner. Where has he to run to?&rdquo; the
Englishman asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was born in the land. He has friends. He goes where he chooses. He is
a <i>chabuk sawai</i> (a sharp chap). It needs only to change his clothing, and
in a twinkling he would be a low-caste Hindu boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The deuce he would!&rdquo; The Englishman looked critically at the boy
as Mahbub headed towards the barracks. Kim ground his teeth. Mahbub was mocking
him, as faithless Afghans will; for he went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They will send him to a school and put heavy boots on his feet and
swaddle him in these clothes. Then he will forget all he knows. Now, which of
the barracks is thine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim pointed&mdash;he could not speak&mdash;to Father Victor&rsquo;s wing, all
staring white near by.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps he will make a good soldier,&rdquo; said Mahbub reflectively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He will make a good orderly at least. I sent him to deliver a message
once from Lahore. A message concerning the pedigree of a white stallion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here was deadly insult on deadlier injury&mdash;and the Sahib to whom he had so
craftily given that war-waking letter heard it all. Kim beheld Mahbub Ali
frying in flame for his treachery, but for himself he saw one long grey vista
of barracks, schools, and barracks again. He gazed imploringly at the clear-cut
face in which there was no glimmer of recognition; but even at this extremity
it never occurred to him to throw himself on the white man&rsquo;s mercy or to
denounce the Afghan. And Mahbub stared deliberately at the Englishman, who
stared as deliberately at Kim, quivering and tongue-tied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My horse is well trained,&rdquo; said the dealer. &ldquo;Others would
have kicked, Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Englishman at last, rubbing his pony&rsquo;s damp
withers with his whip-butt. &ldquo;Who makes the boy a soldier?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says the Regiment that found him, and especially the Padre-sahib of
that regiment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is the Padre!&rdquo; Kim choked as bare-headed Father Victor
sailed down upon them from the veranda.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Powers O&rsquo; Darkness below, O&rsquo;Hara! How many more mixed
friends do you keep in Asia?&rdquo; he cried, as Kim slid down and stood
helplessly before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good morning, Padre,&rdquo; the Englishman said cheerily. &ldquo;I know
you by reputation well enough. Meant to have come over and called before this.
I&rsquo;m Creighton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of the Ethnological Survey?&rdquo; said Father Victor. The Englishman
nodded. &ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;m glad to meet ye then; an&rsquo; I owe you some
thanks for bringing back the boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No thanks to me, Padre. Besides, the boy wasn&rsquo;t going away. You
don&rsquo;t know old Mahbub Ali.&rdquo; The horse-dealer sat impassive in the
sunlight. &ldquo;You will when you have been in the station a month. He sells
us all our crocks. That boy is rather a curiosity. Can you tell me anything
about him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can I tell you?&rdquo; puffed Father Victor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be the
one man that could help me in my quandaries. Tell you! Powers o&rsquo;
Darkness, I&rsquo;m bursting to tell someone who knows something o&rsquo; the
native!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A groom came round the corner. Colonel Creighton raised his voice, speaking in
Urdu. &ldquo;Very good, Mahbub Ali, but what is the use of telling me all those
stories about the pony? Not one pice more than three hundred and fifty rupees
will I give.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Sahib is a little hot and angry after riding,&rdquo; the
horse-dealer returned, with the leer of a privileged jester. &ldquo;Presently,
he will see my horse&rsquo;s points more clearly. I will wait till he has
finished his talk with the Padre. I will wait under that tree.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Confound you!&rdquo; The Colonel laughed. &ldquo;That comes of looking
at one of Mahbub&rsquo;s horses. He&rsquo;s a regular old leech, Padre. Wait,
then, if thou hast so much time to spare, Mahbub. Now I&rsquo;m at your
service, Padre. Where is the boy? Oh, he&rsquo;s gone off to collogue with
Mahbub. Queer sort of boy. Might I ask you to send my mare round under
cover?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He dropped into a chair which commanded a clear view of Kim and Mahbub Ali in
conference beneath the tree. The Padre went indoors for cheroots.
</p>

<p>
Creighton heard Kim say bitterly: &ldquo;Trust a Brahmin before a snake, and a
snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is all one.&rdquo; The great red beard wagged solemnly.
&ldquo;Children should not see a carpet on the loom till the pattern is made
plain. Believe me, Friend of all the World, I do thee great service. They will
not make a soldier of thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You crafty old sinner!&rdquo; thought Creighton. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re
not far wrong. That boy mustn&rsquo;t be wasted if he is as advertised.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me half a minute,&rdquo; cried the Padre from within, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; the documents in the case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If through me the favour of this bold and wise Colonel Sahib comes to
thee, and thou art raised to honour, what thanks wilt thou give Mahbub Ali when
thou art a man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, nay! I begged thee to let me take the Road again, where I should
have been safe; and thou hast sold me back to the English. What will they give
thee for blood-money?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A cheerful young demon!&rdquo; The Colonel bit his cigar, and turned
politely to Father Victor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are the letters that the fat priest is waving before the Colonel?
Stand behind the stallion as though looking at my bridle!&rdquo; said Mahbub
Ali.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A letter from my lama which he wrote from Jagadhir Road, saying that he
will pay three hundred rupees by the year for my schooling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho! Is old Red Hat of that sort? At which school?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God knows. I think in Nucklao.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. There is a big school there for the sons of Sahibs&mdash;and
half-Sahibs. I have seen it when I sell horses there. So the lama also loved
the Friend of all the World?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay; and <i>he</i> did not tell lies, or return me to captivity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Small wonder the Padre does not know how to unravel the thread. How fast
he talks to the Colonel Sahib!&rdquo; Mahbub Ali chuckled. &ldquo;By
Allah!&rdquo; the keen eyes swept the veranda for an Instant&mdash;&ldquo;thy
lama has sent what to me looks like a note of hand. I have had some few
dealings in <i>hoondies</i>. The Colonel Sahib is looking at it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What good is all this to me?&rdquo; said Kim wearily. &ldquo;Thou wilt
go away, and they will return me to those empty rooms where there is no good
place to sleep and where the boys beat me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not think that. Have patience, child. All Pathans are not
faithless&mdash;except in horseflesh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Five&mdash;ten&mdash;fifteen minutes passed, Father Victor talking
energetically or asking questions which the Colonel answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve told you everything that I know about the boy from
beginnin to end; and it&rsquo;s a blessed relief to me. Did ye ever hear the
like?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At any rate, the old man has sent the money. Gobind Sahai&rsquo;s notes
of hand are good from here to China,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;The more
one knows about natives the less can one say what they will or won&rsquo;t
do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s consolin&rsquo;&mdash;from the head of the Ethnological
Survey. It&rsquo;s this mixture of Red Bulls and Rivers of Healing (poor
heathen, God help him!) an&rsquo; notes of hand and Masonic certificates. Are
you a Mason, by any chance?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, I am, now I come to think of it. That&rsquo;s an additional
reason,&rdquo; said the Colonel absently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad ye see a reason in it. But as I said, it&rsquo;s the
mixture o&rsquo; things that&rsquo;s beyond me. An&rsquo; his prophesyin&rsquo;
to our Colonel, sitting on my bed with his little shimmy torn open showing his
white skin; an&rsquo; the prophecy comin&rsquo; true! They&rsquo;ll cure all
that nonsense at St Xavier&rsquo;s, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sprinkle him with holy water,&rdquo; the Colonel laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On my word, I fancy I ought to sometimes. But I&rsquo;m hoping
he&rsquo;ll be brought up as a good Catholic. All that troubles me is
what&rsquo;ll happen if the old beggar-man&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lama, lama, my dear sir; and some of them are gentlemen in their own
country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The lama, then, fails to pay next year. He&rsquo;s a fine business head
to plan on the spur of the moment, but he&rsquo;s bound to die some day.
An&rsquo; takin&rsquo; a heathen&rsquo;s money to give a child a Christian
education&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he said explicitly what he wanted. As soon as he knew the boy was
white he seems to have made his arrangements accordingly. I&rsquo;d give a
month&rsquo;s pay to hear how he explained it all at the Tirthankars&rsquo;
Temple at Benares. Look here, Padre, I don&rsquo;t pretend to know much about
natives, but if he says he&rsquo;ll pay, he&rsquo;ll pay&mdash;dead or alive. I
mean, his heirs will assume the debt. My advice to you is, send the boy down to
Lucknow. If your Anglican Chaplain thinks you&rsquo;ve stolen a march on
him&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bad luck to Bennett! He was sent to the Front instead o&rsquo; me.
Doughty certified me medically unfit. I&rsquo;ll excommunicate Doughty if he
comes back alive! Surely Bennett ought to be content with&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Glory, leaving you the religion. Quite so! As a matter of fact I
don&rsquo;t think Bennett will mind. Put the blame on me.
I&mdash;er&mdash;strongly recommend sending the boy to St Xavier&rsquo;s. He
can go down on pass as a soldier&rsquo;s orphan, so the railway fare will be
saved. You can buy him an outfit from the Regimental subscription. The Lodge
will be saved the expense of his education, and that will put the Lodge in a
good temper. It&rsquo;s perfectly easy. I&rsquo;ve got to go down to Lucknow
next week. I&rsquo;ll look after the boy on the way&mdash;give him in charge of
my servants, and so on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least. Don&rsquo;t make that mistake. The lama has sent us
money for a definite end. We can&rsquo;t very well return it. We shall have to
do as he says. Well, that&rsquo;s settled, isn&rsquo;t it? Shall we say that,
Tuesday next, you&rsquo;ll hand him over to me at the night train south?
That&rsquo;s only three days. He can&rsquo;t do much harm in three days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a weight off my mind, but&mdash;this thing
here?&rdquo;&mdash;he waved the note of hand&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
Gobind Sahai: or his bank, which may be a hole in a wall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i>&rsquo;ve never been a subaltern in debt. I&rsquo;ll cash it
if you like, and send you the vouchers in proper order.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But with all your own work too! It&rsquo;s askin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the least trouble indeed. You see, as an ethnologist, the
thing&rsquo;s very interesting to me. I&rsquo;d like to make a note of it for
some Government work that I&rsquo;m doing. The transformation of a regimental
badge like your Red Bull into a sort of fetish that the boy follows is very
interesting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t thank you enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing you can do. All we Ethnological men are as
jealous as jackdaws of one another&rsquo;s discoveries. They&rsquo;re of no
interest to anyone but ourselves, of course, but you know what book-collectors
are like. Well, don&rsquo;t say a word, directly or indirectly, about the
Asiatic side of the boy&rsquo;s character&mdash;his adventures and his
prophecy, and so on. I&rsquo;ll worm them out of the boy later on and&mdash;you
see?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do. Ye&rsquo;ll make a wonderful account of it. Never a word will I
say to anyone till I see it in print.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you. That goes straight to an ethnologist&rsquo;s heart. Well, I
must be getting back to my breakfast. Good Heavens! Old Mahbub here
still?&rdquo; He raised his voice, and the horse-dealer came out from under the
shadow of the tree, &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As regards that young horse,&rdquo; said Mahbub, &ldquo;I say that when
a colt is born to be a polo-pony, closely following the ball without
teaching&mdash;when such a colt knows the game by divination&mdash;then I say
it is a great wrong to break that colt to a heavy cart, Sahib!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So say I also, Mahbub. The colt will be entered for polo only. (These
fellows think of nothing in the world but horses, Padre.) I&rsquo;ll see you
tomorrow, Mahbub, if you&rsquo;ve anything likely for sale.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The dealer saluted, horseman-fashion, with a sweep of the off hand. &ldquo;Be
patient a little, Friend of all the World,&rdquo; he whispered to the agonized
Kim. &ldquo;Thy fortune is made. In a little while thou goest to Nucklao,
and&mdash;here is something to pay the letter-writer. I shall see thee again, I
think, many times,&rdquo; and he cantered off down the road.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said the Colonel from the veranda, speaking in the
vernacular. &ldquo;In three days thou wilt go with me to Lucknow, seeing and
hearing new things all the while. Therefore sit still for three days and do not
run away. Thou wilt go to school at Lucknow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I meet my Holy One there?&rdquo; Kim whimpered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At least Lucknow is nearer to Benares than Umballa. It may be thou wilt
go under my protection. Mahbub Ali knows this, and he will be angry if thou
returnest to the Road now. Remember&mdash;much has been told me which I do not
forget.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will wait,&rdquo; said Kim, &ldquo;but the boys will beat me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then the bugles blew for dinner.

</p>

<p>
In the afternoon the red-faced schoolmaster told Kim that he had been
&ldquo;struck off the strength&rdquo;, which conveyed no meaning to him till he
was ordered to go away and play. Then he ran to the bazar, and found the young
letter-writer to whom he owed a stamp.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now I pay,&rdquo; said Kim royally, &ldquo;and now I need another letter
to be written.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mahbub Ali is in Umballa,&rdquo; said the writer jauntily. He was, by
virtue of his office, a bureau of general misinformation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is not to Mahbub, but to a priest. Take thy pen and write quickly.
<i>To Teshoo Lama, the Holy One from Bhotiyal seeking for a River, who is now
in the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares.</i> Take more ink! <i>In three
days I am to go down to Nucklao to the school at Nucklao. The name of the
school is Xavier. I do not know where that school is, but it is at
Nucklao.</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I know Nucklao,&rdquo; the writer interrupted. &ldquo;I know the
school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell him where it is, and I give half an anna.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The reed pen scratched busily. &ldquo;He cannot mistake.&rdquo; The man lifted
his head. &ldquo;Who watches us across the street?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim looked up hurriedly and saw Colonel Creighton in tennis-flannels.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that is some Sahib who knows the fat priest in the barracks. He is
beckoning me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What dost thou?&rdquo; said the Colonel, when Kim trotted up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I am not running away. I send a letter to my Holy One at
Benares.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had not thought of that. Hast thou said that I take thee to
Lucknow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, I have not. Read the letter, if there be a doubt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why hast thou left out my name in writing to that Holy One?&rdquo;
The Colonel smiled a queer smile. Kim took his courage in both hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was said once to me that it is inexpedient to write the names of
strangers concerned in any matter, because by the naming of names many good
plans are brought to confusion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou hast been well taught,&rdquo; the Colonel replied, and Kim flushed.
&ldquo;I have left my cheroot-case in the Padre&rsquo;s veranda. Bring it to my
house this even.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is the house?&rdquo; said Kim. His quick wit told him that he was
being tested in some fashion or another, and he stood on guard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ask anyone in the big bazar.&rdquo; The Colonel walked on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has forgotten his cheroot-case,&rdquo; said Kim, returning. &ldquo;I
must bring it to him this evening. That is all my letter except, thrice over,
<i>Come to me! Come to me! Come to me!</i> Now I will pay for a stamp and put
it in the post. He rose to go, and as an afterthought asked: &ldquo;Who is that
angry-faced Sahib who lost the cheroot-case?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he is only Creighton Sahib&mdash;a very foolish Sahib, who is a
Colonel Sahib without a regiment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is his business?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God knows. He is always buying horses which he cannot ride, and asking
riddles about the works of God&mdash;such as plants and stones and the customs
of people. The dealers call him the father of fools, because he is so easily
cheated about a horse. Mahbub Ali says he is madder than most other
Sahibs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Kim, and departed. His training had given him some small
knowledge of character, and he argued that fools are not given information
which leads to calling out eight thousand men besides guns. The
Commander-in-Chief of all India does not talk, as Kim had heard him talk, to
fools. Nor would Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s tone have changed, as it did every time he
mentioned the Colonel&rsquo;s name, if the Colonel had been a fool.
Consequently&mdash;and this set Kim to skipping&mdash;there was a mystery
somewhere, and Mahbub Ali probably spied for the Colonel much as Kim had spied
for Mahbub. And, like the horse-dealer, the Colonel evidently respected people
who did not show themselves to be too clever.
</p>

<p>
He rejoiced that he had not betrayed his knowledge of the Colonel&rsquo;s
house; and when, on his return to barracks, he discovered that no cheroot-case
had been left behind, he beamed with delight. Here was a man after his own
heart&mdash;a tortuous and indirect person playing a hidden game. Well, if he
could be a fool, so could Kim.
</p>

<p>
He showed nothing of his mind when Father Victor, for three long mornings,
discoursed to him of an entirely new set of Gods and Godlings&mdash;notably of
a Goddess called Mary, who, he gathered, was one with Bibi Miriam of Mahbub
Ali&rsquo;s theology. He betrayed no emotion when, after the lecture, Father
Victor dragged him from shop to shop buying articles of outfit, nor when
envious drummer-boys kicked him because he was going to a superior school did
he complain, but awaited the play of circumstances with an interested soul.
Father Victor, good man, took him to the station, put him into an empty
second-class next to Colonel Creighton&rsquo;s first, and bade him farewell
with genuine feeling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll make a man o&rsquo; you, O&rsquo;Hara, at St
Xavier&rsquo;s&mdash;a white man, an&rsquo;, I hope, a good man. They know all
about your comin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the Colonel will see that ye&rsquo;re not
lost or mislaid anywhere on the road. I&rsquo;ve given you a notion of
religious matters,&mdash;at least I hope so,&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll remember,
when they ask you your religion, that you&rsquo;re a Cath&rsquo;lic. Better say
Roman Cath&rsquo;lic, tho&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not fond of the word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim lit a rank cigarette&mdash;he had been careful to buy a stock in the
bazar&mdash;and lay down to think. This solitary passage was very different
from that joyful down-journey in the third-class with the lama. &ldquo;Sahibs
get little pleasure of travel,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;<i>Hai mai!</i> I go
from one place to another as it might be a kickball. It is my <i>Kismet</i>. No
man can escape his <i>Kismet</i>. But I am to pray to Bibi Miriam, and I am a
Sahib.&rdquo; He looked at his boots ruefully. &ldquo;No; I am Kim. This is the
great world, and I am only Kim. Who is Kim?&rdquo; He considered his own
identity, a thing he had never done before, till his head swam. He was one
insignificant person in all this roaring whirl of India, going southward to he
knew not what fate.
</p>

<p>
Presently the Colonel sent for him, and talked for a long time. So far as Kim
could gather, he was to be diligent and enter the Survey of India as a
chain-man. If he were very good, and passed the proper examinations, he would
be earning thirty rupees a month at seventeen years old, and Colonel Creighton
would see that he found suitable employment.
</p>

<p>
Kim pretended at first to understand perhaps one word in three of this talk.
Then the Colonel, seeing his mistake, turned to fluent and picturesque Urdu and
Kim was contented. No man could be a fool who knew the language so intimately,
who moved so gently and silently, and whose eyes were so different from the
dull fat eyes of other Sahibs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and thou must learn how to make pictures of roads and mountains and
rivers, to carry these pictures in thine eye till a suitable time comes to set
them upon paper. Perhaps some day, when thou art a chain-man, I may say to thee
when we are working together: &lsquo;Go across those hills and see what lies
beyond.&rsquo; Then one will say: &lsquo;There are bad people living in those
hills who will slay the chain-man if he be seen to look like a Sahib.&rsquo;
What then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim thought. Would it be safe to return the Colonel&rsquo;s lead?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would tell what that other man had said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if I answered: &lsquo;I will give thee a hundred rupees for
knowledge of what is behind those hills&mdash;for a picture of a river and a
little news of what the people say in the villages there&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I tell? I am only a boy. Wait till I am a man.&rdquo; Then,
seeing the Colonel&rsquo;s brow clouded, he went on: &ldquo;But I think I
should in a few days earn the hundred rupees.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By what road?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim shook his head resolutely. &ldquo;If I said how I would earn them, another
man might hear and forestall me. It is not good to sell knowledge for
nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell now.&rdquo; The Colonel held up a rupee. Kim&rsquo;s hand half
reached towards it, and dropped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, Sahib; nay. I know the price that will be paid for the answer, but
I do not know why the question is asked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take it for a gift, then,&rdquo; said Creighton, tossing it over.
&ldquo;There is a good spirit in thee. Do not let it be blunted at St
Xavier&rsquo;s. There are many boys there who despise the black men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Their mothers were bazar-women,&rdquo; said Kim. He knew well there is
no hatred like that of the half-caste for his brother-in-law.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True; but thou art a Sahib and the son of a Sahib. Therefore, do not at
any time be led to contemn the black men. I have known boys newly entered into
the service of the Government who feigned not to understand the talk or the
customs of black men. Their pay was cut for ignorance. There is no sin so great
as ignorance. Remember this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Several times in the course of the long twenty-four hours&rsquo; run south did
the Colonel send for Kim, always developing this latter text.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We be all on one lead-rope, then,&rdquo; said Kim at last, &ldquo;the
Colonel, Mahbub Ali, and I&mdash;when I become a chain-man. He will use me as
Mahbub Ali employed me, I think. That is good, if it allows me to return to the
Road again. This clothing grows no easier by wear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When they came to the crowded Lucknow station there was no sign of the lama. He
swallowed his disappointment, while the Colonel bundled him into a
<i>ticca-gharri</i> with his neat belongings and despatched him alone to St
Xavier&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not say farewell, because we shall meet again,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Again, and many times, if thou art one of good spirit. But thou art not
yet tried.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not when I brought thee&rdquo;&mdash;Kim actually dared to use the
<i>tum</i> of equals&mdash;&ldquo;a white stallion&rsquo;s pedigree that
night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much is gained by forgetting, little brother,&rdquo; said the Colonel,
with a look that pierced through Kim&rsquo;s shoulder-blades as he scuttled
into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
It took him nearly five minutes to recover. Then he sniffed the new air
appreciatively. &ldquo;A rich city,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Richer than Lahore.
How good the bazars must be! Coachman, drive me a little through the bazars
here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My order is to take thee to the school.&rdquo; The driver used the
&ldquo;thou&rdquo;, which is rudeness when applied to a white man. In the
clearest and most fluent vernacular Kim pointed out his error, climbed on to
the box-seat, and, perfect understanding established, drove for a couple of
hours up and down, estimating, comparing, and enjoying. There is no
city&mdash;except Bombay, the queen of all&mdash;more beautiful in her garish
style than Lucknow, whether you see her from the bridge over the river, or from
the top of the Imambara looking down on the gilt umbrellas of the Chutter
Munzil, and the trees in which the town is bedded. Kings have adorned her with
fantastic buildings, endowed her with charities, crammed her with pensioners,
and drenched her with blood. She is the centre of all idleness, intrigue, and
luxury, and shares with Delhi the claim to talk the only pure Urdu.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fair city&mdash;a beautiful city.&rdquo; The driver, as a Lucknow man,
was pleased with the compliment, and told Kim many astounding things where an
English guide would have talked of the Mutiny.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now we will go to the school,&rdquo; said Kim at last. The great old
school of St Xavier&rsquo;s in Partibus, block on block of low white buildings,
stands in vast grounds over against the Gumti River, at some distance from the
city.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What like of folk are they within?&rdquo; said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Young Sahibs&mdash;all devils. But to speak truth, and I drive many of
them to and fro from the railway station, I have never seen one that had in him
the making of a more perfect devil than thou&mdash;this young Sahib whom I am
now driving.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naturally, for he was never trained to consider them in any way improper, Kim
had passed the time of day with one or two frivolous ladies at upper windows in
a certain street, and naturally, in the exchange of compliments, had acquitted
himself well. He was about to acknowledge the driver&rsquo;s last insolence,
when his eye&mdash;it was growing dusk&mdash;caught a figure sitting by one of
the white plaster gate-pillars in the long sweep of wall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Stay here. I do not go to the school at
once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what is to pay me for this coming and re-coming?&rdquo; said the
driver petulantly. &ldquo;Is the boy mad? Last time it was a dancing-girl. This
time it is a priest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim was in the road headlong, patting the dusty feet beneath the dirty yellow
robe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have waited here a day and a half,&rdquo; the lama&rsquo;s level voice
began. &ldquo;Nay, I had a disciple with me. He that was my friend at the
Temple of the Tirthankars gave me a guide for this journey. I came from Benares
in the <i>te-rain</i>, when thy letter was given me. Yes, I am well fed. I need
nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why didst thou not stay with the Kulu woman, O Holy One? In what way
didst thou get to Benares? My heart has been heavy since we parted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The woman wearied me by constant flux of talk and requiring charms for
children. I separated myself from that company, permitting her to acquire merit
by gifts. She is at least a woman of open hands, and I made a promise to return
to her house if need arose. Then, perceiving myself alone in this great and
terrible world, I bethought me of the <i>te-rain</i> to Benares, where I knew
one abode in the Tirthankars&rsquo; Temple who was a Seeker, even as I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! Thy River,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;I had forgotten the River.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So soon, my <i>chela?</i> I have never forgotten it. But when I had left
thee it seemed better that I should go to the Temple and take counsel, for,
look you, India is very large, and it may be that wise men before us, some two
or three, have left a record of the place of our River. There is debate in the
Temple of the Tirthankars on this matter; some saying one thing, and some
another. They are courteous folk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So be it; but what dost thou do now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I acquire merit in that I help thee, my <i>chela</i>, to wisdom. The
priest of that body of men who serve the Red Bull wrote me that all should be
as I desired for thee. I sent the money to suffice for one year, and then I
came, as thou seest me, to watch for thee going up into the Gates of Learning.
A day and a half have I waited, not because I was led by any affection towards
thee&mdash;that is no part of the Way&mdash;but, as they said at the
Tirthankars&rsquo; Temple, because, money having been paid for learning, it was
right that I should oversee the end of the matter. They resolved my doubts most
clearly. I had a fear that, perhaps, I came because I wished to see
thee&mdash;misguided by the Red Mist of affection. It is not so ... Moreover, I
am troubled by a dream.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But surely, Holy One, thou hast not forgotten the Road and all that
befell on it. Surely it was a little to see me that thou didst come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The horses are cold, and it is past their feeding-time,&rdquo; whined
the driver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go to Jehannum and abide there with thy reputationless aunt!&rdquo; Kim
snarled over his shoulder. &ldquo;I am all alone in this land; I know not where
I go nor what shall befall me. My heart was in that letter I sent thee. Except
for Mahbub Ali, and he is a Pathan, I have no friend save thee, Holy One. Do
not altogether go away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have considered that also,&rdquo; the lama replied, in a shaking
voice. &ldquo;It is manifest that from time to time I shall acquire merit if
before that I have not found my River&mdash;by assuring myself that thy feet
are set on wisdom. What they will teach thee I do not know, but the priest
wrote me that no son of a Sahib in all India will be better taught than thou.
So from time to time, therefore, I will come again. Maybe thou wilt be such a
Sahib as he who gave me these spectacles&rdquo;&mdash;the lama wiped them
elaborately&mdash;&ldquo;in the Wonder House at Lahore. That is my hope, for he
was a Fountain of Wisdom&mdash;wiser than many abbots .... Again, maybe thou
wilt forget me and our meetings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I eat thy bread,&rdquo; cried Kim passionately, &ldquo;how shall I
ever forget thee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;no.&rdquo; He put the boy aside. &ldquo;I must go back to
Benares. From time to time, now that I know the customs of letter-writers in
this land, I will send thee a letter, and from time to time I will come and see
thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But whither shall I send my letters?&rdquo; wailed Kim, clutching at the
robe, all forgetful that he was a Sahib.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares. That is the place I have
chosen till I find my River. Do not weep; for, look you, all Desire is Illusion
and a new binding upon the Wheel. Go up to the Gates of Learning. Let me see
thee go ... Dost thou love me? Then go, or my heart cracks ... I will come
again. Surely I will come again.
</p>

<p>
The lama watched the <i>ticca-gharri</i> rumble into the compound, and strode
off, snuffing between each long stride.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Gates of Learning&rdquo; shut with a clang.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The country born and bred boy has his own manners and customs, which do not
resemble those of any other land; and his teachers approach him by roads which
an English master would not understand. Therefore, you would scarcely be
interested in Kim&rsquo;s experiences as a St Xavier&rsquo;s boy among two or
three hundred precocious youths, most of whom had never seen the sea. He
suffered the usual penalties for breaking out of bounds when there was cholera
in the city. This was before he had learned to write fair English, and so was
obliged to find a bazar letter-writer. He was, of course, indicted for smoking
and for the use of abuse more full-flavoured than even St Xavier&rsquo;s had
ever heard. He learned to wash himself with the Levitical scrupulosity of the
native-born, who in his heart considers the Englishman rather dirty. He played
the usual tricks on the patient coolies pulling the punkahs in the
sleeping-rooms where the boys threshed through the hot nights telling tales
till the dawn; and quietly he measured himself against his self-reliant mates.
</p>

<p>
They were sons of subordinate officials in the Railway, Telegraph, and Canal
Services; of warrant-officers, sometimes retired and sometimes acting as
commanders-in-chief to a feudatory Rajah&rsquo;s army; of captains of the
Indian Marine Government pensioners, planters, Presidency shopkeepers, and
missionaries. A few were cadets of the old Eurasian houses that have taken
strong root in Dhurrumtollah&mdash;Pereiras, De Souzas, and D&rsquo;Silvas.
Their parents could well have educated them in England, but they loved the
school that had served their own youth, and generation followed sallow-hued
generation at St Xavier&rsquo;s. Their homes ranged from Howrah of the railway
people to abandoned cantonments like Monghyr and Chunar; lost tea-gardens
Shillong-way; villages where their fathers were large landholders in Oudh or
the Deccan; Mission-stations a week from the nearest railway line; seaports a
thousand miles south, facing the brazen Indian surf; and cinchona-plantations
south of all. The mere story of their adventures, which to them were no
adventures, on their road to and from school would have crisped a Western
boy&rsquo;s hair. They were used to jogging off alone through a hundred miles
of jungle, where there was always the delightful chance of being delayed by
tigers; but they would no more have bathed in the English Channel in an English
August than their brothers across the world would have lain still while a
leopard snuffed at their palanquin. There were boys of fifteen who had spent a
day and a half on an islet in the middle of a flooded river, taking charge, as
by right, of a camp of frantic pilgrims returning from a shrine. There were
seniors who had requisitioned a chance-met Rajah&rsquo;s elephant, in the name
of St Francis Xavier, when the Rains once blotted out the cart-track that led
to their father&rsquo;s estate, and had all but lost the huge beast in a
quicksand. There was a boy who, he said, and none doubted, had helped his
father to beat off with rifles from the veranda a rush of Akas in the days when
those head-hunters were bold against lonely plantations.
</p>

<p>
And every tale was told in the even, passionless voice of the native-born,
mixed with quaint reflections, borrowed unconsciously from native
foster-mothers, and turns of speech that showed they had been that instant
translated from the vernacular. Kim watched, listened, and approved. This was
not insipid, single-word talk of drummer-boys. It dealt with a life he knew and
in part understood. The atmosphere suited him, and he throve by inches. They
gave him a white drill suit as the weather warmed, and he rejoiced in the
new-found bodily comforts as he rejoiced to use his sharpened mind over the
tasks they set him. His quickness would have delighted an English master; but
at St Xavier&rsquo;s they know the first rush of minds developed by sun and
surroundings, as they know the half-collapse that sets in at twenty-two or
twenty-three.
</p>

<p>
None the less he remembered to hold himself lowly. When tales were told of hot
nights, Kim did not sweep the board with his reminiscences; for St
Xavier&rsquo;s looks down on boys who &ldquo;go native all-together.&rdquo; One
must never forget that one is a Sahib, and that some day, when examinations are
passed, one will command natives. Kim made a note of this, for he began to
understand where examinations led.
</p>

<p>
Then came the holidays from August to October&mdash;the long holidays imposed
by the heat and the Rains. Kim was informed that he would go north to some
station in the hills behind Umballa, where Father Victor would arrange for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A barrack-school?&rdquo; said Kim, who had asked many questions and
thought more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said the master. &ldquo;It will not do you any
harm to keep you out of mischief. You can go up with young De Castro as far as
Delhi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim considered it in every possible light. He had been diligent, even as the
Colonel advised. A boy&rsquo;s holiday was his own property&mdash;of so much
the talk of his companions had advised him,&mdash;and a barrack-school would be
torment after St Xavier&rsquo;s. Moreover&mdash;this was magic worth anything
else&mdash;he could write. In three months he had discovered how men can speak
to each other without a third party, at the cost of half an anna and a little
knowledge. No word had come from the lama, but there remained the Road. Kim
yearned for the caress of soft mud squishing up between the toes, as his mouth
watered for mutton stewed with butter and cabbages, for rice speckled with
strong scented cardamoms, for the saffron-tinted rice, garlic and onions, and
the forbidden greasy sweetmeats of the bazars. They would feed him raw beef on
a platter at the barrack-school, and he must smoke by stealth. But again, he
was a Sahib and was at St Xavier&rsquo;s, and that pig Mahbub Ali ... No, he
would not test Mahbub&rsquo;s hospitality&mdash;and yet ... He thought it out
alone in the dormitory, and came to the conclusion he had been unjust to
Mahbub.
</p>

<p>
The school was empty; nearly all the masters had gone away; Colonel
Creighton&rsquo;s railway pass lay in his hand, and Kim puffed himself that he
had not spent Colonel Creighton&rsquo;s or Mahbub&rsquo;s money in riotous
living. He was still lord of two rupees seven annas. His new bullock-trunk,
marked &ldquo;K. O&rsquo;H.&rdquo;, and bedding-roll lay in the empty
sleeping-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sahibs are always tied to their baggage,&rdquo; said Kim, nodding at
them. &ldquo;You will stay here&rdquo; He went out into the warm rain, smiling
sinfully, and sought a certain house whose outside he had noted down some time
before...
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Arre&rdquo;! Dost thou know what manner of women we be in this quarter?
Oh, shame!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was I born yesterday?&rdquo; Kim squatted native-fashion on the cushions
of that upper room. &ldquo;A little dyestuff and three yards of cloth to help
out a jest. Is it much to ask?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is <i>she?</i> Thou art full young, as Sahibs go, for this
devilry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she? She is the daughter of a certain schoolmaster of a regiment in
the cantonments. He has beaten me twice because I went over their wall in these
clothes. Now I would go as a gardener&rsquo;s boy. Old men are very
jealous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is true. Hold thy face still while I dab on the juice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not too black, <i>Naikan</i>. I would not appear to her as a
<i>hubshi</i> (nigger).&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, love makes nought of these things. And how old is she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Twelve years, I think,&rdquo; said the shameless Kim. &ldquo;Spread it
also on the breast. It may be her father will tear my clothes off me, and if I
am piebald&mdash;&rdquo; he laughed.
</p>

<p>
The girl worked busily, dabbing a twist of cloth into a little saucer of brown
dye that holds longer than any walnut-juice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now send out and get me a cloth for the turban. Woe is me, my head is
all unshaved! And he will surely knock off my turban.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not a barber, but I will make shift. Thou wast born to be a breaker
of hearts! All this disguise for one evening? Remember, the stuff does not wash
away.&rdquo; She shook with laughter till her bracelets and anklets jingled.
&ldquo;But who is to pay me for this? Huneefa herself could not have given thee
better stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Trust in the Gods, my sister,&rdquo; said Kim gravely, screwing his face
round as the stain dried. &ldquo;Besides, hast thou ever helped to paint a
Sahib thus before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never indeed. But a jest is not money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is worth much more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Child, thou art beyond all dispute the most shameless son of Shaitan
that I have ever known to take up a poor girl&rsquo;s time with this play, and
then to say: &lsquo;Is not the jest enough?&rsquo; Thou wilt go very far in
this world.&rdquo; She gave the dancing-girls&rsquo; salutation in mockery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All one. Make haste and rough-cut my head.&rdquo; Kim shifted from foot
to foot, his eyes ablaze with mirth as he thought of the fat days before him.
He gave the girl four annas, and ran down the stairs in the likeness of a
low-caste Hindu boy&mdash;perfect in every detail. A cookshop was his next
point of call, where he feasted in extravagance and greasy luxury.
</p>

<p>
On Lucknow station platform he watched young De Castro, all covered with
prickly-heat, get into a second-class compartment. Kim patronized a third, and
was the life and soul of it. He explained to the company that he was assistant
to a juggler who had left him behind sick with fever, and that he would pick up
his master at Umballa. As the occupants of the carriage changed, he varied this
tale, or adorned it with all the shoots of a budding fancy, the more rampant
for being held off native speech so long. In all India that night was no human
being so joyful as Kim. At Umballa he got out and headed eastward, plashing
over the sodden fields to the village where the old soldier lived.
</p>

<p>
About this time Colonel Creighton at Simla was advised from Lucknow by wire
that young O&rsquo;Hara had disappeared. Mahbub Ali was in town selling horses,
and to him the Colonel confided the affair one morning cantering round
Annandale racecourse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that is nothing,&rdquo; said the horse-dealer. &ldquo;Men are like
horses. At certain times they need salt, and if that salt is not in the mangers
they will lick it up from the earth. He has gone back to the Road again for a
while. The <i>madrissah</i> wearied him. I knew it would. Another time, I will
take him upon the Road myself. Do not be troubled, Creighton Sahib. It is as
though a polo-pony, breaking loose, ran out to learn the game alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then he is not dead, think you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fever might kill him. I do not fear for the boy otherwise. A monkey does
not fall among trees.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Next morning, on the same course, Mahbub&rsquo;s stallion ranged alongside the
Colonel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is as I had thought,&rdquo; said the horse-dealer. &ldquo;He has come
through Umballa at least, and there he has written a letter to me, having
learned in the bazar that I was here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Read,&rdquo; said the Colonel, with a sigh of relief. It was absurd that
a man of his position should take an interest in a little country-bred
vagabond; but the Colonel remembered the conversation in the train, and often
in the past few months had caught himself thinking of the queer, silent,
self-possessed boy. His evasion, of course, was the height of insolence, but it
argued some resource and nerve.
</p>

<p>
Mahbub&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as he reined out into the centre of the cramped
little plain, where none could come near unseen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>The Friend of the Stars, who is the Friend of all the
World</i>&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A name we give him in Lahore city. &lsquo;<i>The Friend of all the World
takes leave to go to his own places. He will come back upon the appointed day.
Let the box and the bedding-roll be sent for; and if there has been a fault,
let the Hand of Friendship turn aside the Whip of Calamity.</i>&rsquo; There is
yet a little more, but&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No matter, read.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Certain things are not known to those who eat with forks. It
is better to eat with both hands for a while. Speak soft words to those who do
not understand this that the return may be propitious.</i>&rsquo; Now the
manner in which that was cast is, of course, the work of the letter-writer, but
see how wisely the boy has devised the matter of it so that no hint is given
except to those who know!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this the Hand of Friendship to avert the Whip of Calamity?&rdquo;
laughed the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See how wise is the boy. He would go back to the Road again, as I said.
Not knowing yet thy trade&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not at all sure of that,&rdquo; the Colonel muttered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He turns to me to make a peace between you. Is he not wise? He says he
will return. He is but perfecting his knowledge. Think, Sahib! He has been
three months at the school. And he is not mouthed to that bit. For my part, I
rejoice. The pony learns the game.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but another time he must not go alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why? He went alone before he came under the Colonel Sahib&rsquo;s
protection. When he comes to the Great Game he must go alone&mdash;alone, and
at peril of his head. <i>Then</i>, if he spits, or sneezes, or sits down other
than as the people do whom he watches, he may be slain. Why hinder him now?
Remember how the Persians say: The jackal that lives in the wilds of Mazanderan
can only be caught by the hounds of Mazanderan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True. It is true, Mahbub Ali. And if he comes to no harm, I do not
desire anything better. But it is great insolence on his part.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He does not tell me, even, whither he goes,&rdquo; said Mahbub.
&ldquo;He is no fool. When his time is accomplished he will come to me. It is
time the healer of pearls took him in hand. He ripens too quickly&mdash;as
Sahibs reckon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later. Mahbub had gone down
to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses, and Kim met him on the
Kalka road at dusk riding alone, begged an alms of him, was sworn at, and
replied in English. There was nobody within earshot to hear Mahbub&rsquo;s gasp
of amazement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho! And where hast thou been?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Up and down&mdash;down and up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come under a tree, out of the wet, and tell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I stayed for a while with an old man near Umballa; anon with a household
of my acquaintance in Umballa. With one of these I went as far as Delhi to the
southward. That is a wondrous city. Then I drove a bullock for a <i>teli</i>
(an oilman) coming north; but I heard of a great feast forward in Patiala, and
thither went I in the company of a firework-maker. It was a great feast&rdquo;
(Kim rubbed his stomach). &ldquo;I saw Rajahs, and elephants with gold and
silver trappings; and they lit all the fireworks at once, whereby eleven men
were killed, my fire-work-maker among them, and I was blown across a tent but
took no harm. Then I came back to the <i>rêl</i> with a Sikh horseman, to whom
I was groom for my bread; and so here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Shabash!</i>&rdquo; said Mahbub Ali.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what does the Colonel Sahib say? I do not wish to be beaten.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Hand of Friendship has averted the Whip of Calamity; but another
time, when thou takest the Road it will be with me. This is too early.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Late enough for me. I have learned to read and to write English a little
at the <i>madrissah</i>. I shall soon be altogether a Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear him!&rdquo; laughed Mahbub, looking at the little drenched figure
dancing in the wet. &ldquo;Salaam&mdash;Sahib,&rdquo; and he saluted
ironically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, art tired of the Road, or wilt thou come on to Umballa with me and
work back with the horses?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I come with thee, Mahbub Ali.&rdquo;
</p>

Something I owe to the soil that grew&mdash;<br />

<p>
&ldquo;Then in God&rsquo;s name take blue for red,&rdquo; said Mahbub, alluding
to the Hindu colour of Kim&rsquo;s disreputable turban.
</p>

<p>
Kim countered with the old proverb, &ldquo;I will change my faith and my
bedding, but <i>thou</i> must pay for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The dealer laughed till he nearly fell from his horse. At a shop on the
outskirts of the city the change was made, and Kim stood up, externally at
least, a Mohammedan.
</p>

<p>
Mahbub hired a room over against the railway station, sent for a cooked meal of
the finest with the almond-curd sweet-meats (<i>balushai</i> we call it) and
fine-chopped Lucknow tobacco.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is better than some other meat that I ate with the Sikh,&rdquo;
said Kim, grinning as he squatted, &ldquo;and assuredly they give no such
victuals at my <i>madrissah</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a desire to hear of that same <i>madrissah</i>.&rdquo; Mahbub
stuffed himself with great boluses of spiced mutton fried in fat with cabbage
and golden-brown onions. &ldquo;But tell me first, altogether and truthfully,
the manner of thy escape. For, O Friend of all the World,&rdquo;&mdash;he
loosed his cracking belt&mdash;&ldquo;I do not think it is often that a Sahib
and the son of a Sahib runs away from there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How should they? They do not know the land. It was nothing,&rdquo; said
Kim, and began his tale. When he came to the disguisement and the interview
with the girl in the bazar, Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s gravity went from him. He
laughed aloud and beat his hand on his thigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Shabash! Shabash!</i> Oh, well done, little one! What will the healer
of turquoises say to this? Now, slowly, let us hear what befell
afterwards&mdash;step by step, omitting nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Step by step then, Kim told his adventures between coughs as the full-flavoured
tobacco caught his lungs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; growled Mahbub Ali to himself, &ldquo;I <i>said</i> it
was the pony breaking out to play polo. The fruit is ripe already&mdash;except
that he must learn his distances and his pacings, and his rods and his
compasses. Listen now. I have turned aside the Colonel&rsquo;s whip from thy
skin, and that is no small service.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True.&rdquo; Kim pulled serenely. &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it is not to be thought that this running out and in is any way
good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was my holiday, Hajji. I was a slave for many weeks. Why should I not
run away when the school was shut? Look, too, how I, living upon my friends or
working for my bread, as I did with the Sikh, have saved the Colonel Sahib a
great expense.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mahbub&rsquo;s lips twitched under his well-pruned Mohammedan moustache.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are a few rupees&rdquo;&mdash;the Pathan threw out his open hand
carelessly&mdash;&ldquo;to the Colonel Sahib? He spends them for a purpose, not
in any way for love of thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Kim slowly, &ldquo;I knew a very long time ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who told?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Colonel Sahib himself. Not in those many words, but plainly enough
for one who is not altogether a mud-head. Yea, he told me in the <i>te-rain</i>
when we went down to Lucknow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be it so. Then I will tell thee more, Friend of all the World, though in
the telling I lend thee my head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was forfeit to me,&rdquo; said Kim, with deep relish, &ldquo;in
Umballa, when thou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer-boy beat
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speak a little plainer. All the world may tell lies save thou and I. For
equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise my finger here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this is known to me also,&rdquo; said Kim, readjusting the live
charcoal-ball on the weed. &ldquo;It is a very sure tie between us. Indeed, thy
hold is surer even than mine; for who would miss a boy beaten to death, or, it
may be, thrown into a well by the roadside? Most people here and in Simla and
across the passes behind the Hills would, on the other hand, say: &lsquo;What
has come to Mahbub Ali?&rsquo; if he were found dead among his horses. Surely,
too, the Colonel Sahib would make inquiries. But
again,&rdquo;&mdash;Kim&rsquo;s face puckered with cunning,&mdash;&ldquo;he
would not make overlong inquiry, lest people should ask: &lsquo;What has this
Colonel Sahib to do with that horse-dealer?&rsquo; But I&mdash;if I
lived&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As thou wouldst surely die&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It may be; but I say, <i>if</i> I lived, I, and I alone, would know that
one had come by night, as a common thief perhaps, to Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s
bulkhead in the serai, and there had slain him, either before or after that
thief had made a full search into his saddlebags and between the soles of his
slippers. Is that news to tell to the Colonel, or would he say to me&mdash;(I
have not forgotten when he sent me back for a cigar-case that he had <i>not</i>
left behind him)&mdash;&lsquo;What is Mahbub Ali to me?&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Up went a gout of heavy smoke. There was a long pause: then Mahbub Ali spoke in
admiration: &ldquo;And with these things on thy mind, dost thou lie down and
rise again among all the Sahibs&rsquo; little sons at the <i>madrissah</i> and
meekly take instruction from thy teachers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is an order,&rdquo; said Kim blandly. &ldquo;Who am I to dispute an
order?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A most finished Son of Eblis,&rdquo; said Mahbub Ali. &ldquo;But what is
this tale of the thief and the search?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That which I saw,&rdquo; said Kim, &ldquo;the night that my lama and I
lay next thy place in the Kashmir Seral. The door was left unlocked, which I
think is not thy custom, Mahbub. He came in as one assured that thou wouldst
not soon return. My eye was against a knot-hole in the plank. He searched as it
were for something&mdash;not a rug, not stirrups, nor a bridle, nor brass
pots&mdash;something little and most carefully hid. Else why did he prick with
an iron between the soles of thy slippers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Mahbub Ali smiled gently. &ldquo;And seeing these things,
what tale didst thou fashion to thyself, Well of the Truth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None. I put my hand upon my amulet, which lies always next to my skin,
and, remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I had bitten out of a
piece of Mussalmani bread, I went away to Umballa perceiving that a heavy trust
was laid upon me. At that hour, had I chosen, thy head was forfeit. It needed
only to say to that man, &lsquo;I have here a paper concerning a horse which I
cannot read.&rsquo; And then?&rdquo; Kim peered at Mahbub under his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then thou wouldst have drunk water twice&mdash;perhaps thrice,
afterwards. I do not think more than thrice,&rdquo; said Mahbub simply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is true. I thought of that a little, but most I thought that I loved
thee, Mahbub. Therefore I went to Umballa, as thou knowest, but (and this thou
dost not know) I lay hid in the garden-grass to see what Colonel Creighton
Sahib might do upon reading the white stallion&rsquo;s pedigree.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what did he?&rdquo; for Kim had bitten off the conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dost <i>thou</i> give news for love, or dost thou sell it?&rdquo; Kim
asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I sell and&mdash;I buy.&rdquo; Mahbub took a four-anna piece out of his
belt and held it up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eight!&rdquo; said Kim, mechanically following the huckster instinct of
the East.
</p>

<p>
Mahbub laughed, and put away the coin. &ldquo;It is too easy to deal in that
market, Friend of all the World. Tell me for love. Our lives lie in each
other&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good. I saw the Jang-i-Lat Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief] come to a
big dinner. I saw him in Creighton Sahib&rsquo;s office. I saw the two read the
white stallion&rsquo;s pedigree. I heard the very orders given for the opening
of a great war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; Mahbub nodded with deepest eyes afire. &ldquo;The game is
well played. That war is done now, and the evil, we hope, nipped before the
flower&mdash;thanks to me&mdash;and thee. What didst thou later?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and honour among
the villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama. But I bore away the
old man&rsquo;s purse, and the Brahmin found nothing. So next morning he was
angry. Ho! Ho! And I also used the news when I fell into the hands of that
white Regiment with their Bull!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was foolishness.&rdquo; Mahbub scowled. &ldquo;News is not meant to
be thrown about like dung-cakes, but used sparingly&mdash;like
<i>bhang</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I think now, and moreover, it did me no sort of good. But that was
very long ago,&rdquo; he made as to brush it all away with a thin brown
hand&mdash;&ldquo;and since then, and especially in the nights under the punkah
at the <i>madrissah</i>, I have thought very greatly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it permitted to ask whither the Heaven-born&rsquo;s thought might
have led?&rdquo; said Mahbub, with an elaborate sarcasm, smoothing his scarlet
beard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is permitted,&rdquo; said Kim, and threw back the very tone.
&ldquo;They say at Nucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has made
a fault.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mahbub&rsquo;s hand shot into his bosom, for to call a Pathan a &ldquo;black
man&rdquo; (<i>kala admi</i>) is a blood-insult. Then he remembered and
laughed. &ldquo;Speak, Sahib. Thy black man hears.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Kim, &ldquo;I am <i>not</i> a Sahib, and I say I made a
fault to curse thee, Mahbub Ali, on that day at Umballa when I thought I was
betrayed by a Pathan. I was senseless; for I was but newly caught, and I wished
to kill that low-caste drummer-boy. I say now, Hajji, that it was well done;
and I see my road all clear before me to a good service. I will stay in the
<i>madrissah</i> till I am ripe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well said. Especially are distances and numbers and the manner of using
compasses to be learned in that game. One waits in the Hills above to show
thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will learn their teaching upon a condition&mdash;that my time is given
to me without question when the <i>madrissah</i> is shut. Ask that for me of
the Colonel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibs&rsquo; tongue?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Colonel is the servant of the Government. He is sent hither and yon
at a word, and must consider his own advancement. (See how much I have already
learned at Nucklao!) Moreover, the Colonel I know since three months only. I
have known one Mahbub Ali for six years. So! To the <i>madrissah</i> I will go.
At the <i>madrissah</i> I will learn. In the <i>madrissah</i> I will be a
Sahib. But when the <i>madrissah</i> is shut, then must I be free and go among
my people. Otherwise I die!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who are thy people, Friend of all the World?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This great and beautiful land,&rdquo; said Kim, waving his paw round the
little clay-walled room where the oil-lamp in its niche burned heavily through
the tobacco-smoke. &ldquo;And, further, I would see my lama again. And,
further, I need money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is the need of everyone,&rdquo; said Mahbub ruefully. &ldquo;I will
give thee eight annas, for much money is not picked out of horses&rsquo;
hooves, and it must suffice for many days. As to all the rest, I am well
pleased, and no further talk is needed. Make haste to learn, and in three
years, or it may be less, thou wilt be an aid&mdash;even to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have I been such a hindrance till now?&rdquo; said Kim, with a
boy&rsquo;s giggle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not give answers,&rdquo; Mahbub grunted. &ldquo;Thou art my new
horse-boy. Go and bed among my men. They are near the north end of the station,
with the horses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They will beat me to the south end of the station if I come without
authority.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mahbub felt in his belt, wetted his thumb on a cake of Chinese ink, and dabbed
the impression on a piece of soft native paper. From Balkh to Bombay men know
that rough-ridged print with the old scar running diagonally across it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is enough to show my headman. I come in the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By which road?&rdquo; said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the road from the city. There is but one, and then we return to
Creighton Sahib. I have saved thee a beating.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah! What is a beating when the very head is loose on the
shoulders?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim slid out quietly into the night, walked half round the house, keeping close
to the walls, and headed away from the station for a mile or so. Then, fetching
a wide compass, he worked back at leisure, for he needed time to invent a story
if any of Mahbub&rsquo;s retainers asked questions.
</p>

<p>
They were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the railway, and, being
natives, had not, of course, unloaded the two trucks in which Mahbub&rsquo;s
animals stood among a consignment of country-breds bought by the Bombay
tram-company. The headman, a broken-down, consumptive-looking Mohammedan,
promptly challenged Kim, but was pacified at sight of Mahbub&rsquo;s
sign-manual.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Hajji has of his favour given me service,&rdquo; said Kim testily.
&ldquo;If this be doubted, wait till he comes in the morning. Meantime, a place
by the fire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Followed the usual aimless babble that every low-caste native must raise on
every occasion. It died down, and Kim lay out behind the little knot of
Mahbub&rsquo;s followers, almost under the wheels of a horse-truck, a borrowed
blanket for covering. Now a bed among brickbats and ballast-refuse on a damp
night, between overcrowded horses and unwashed Baltis, would not appeal to many
white boys; but Kim was utterly happy. Change of scene, service, and
surroundings were the breath of his little nostrils, and thinking of the neat
white cots of St Xavier&rsquo;s all arow under the punkah gave him joy as keen
as the repetition of the multiplication-table in English.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very old,&rdquo; he thought sleepily. &ldquo;Every month I become a
year more old. I was very young, and a fool to boot, when I took Mahbub&rsquo;s
message to Umballa. Even when I was with that white Regiment I was very young
and small and had no wisdom. But now I learn every day, and in three years the
Colonel will take me out of the <i>madrissah</i> and let me go upon the Road
with Mahbub hunting for horses&rsquo; pedigrees, or maybe I shall go by myself;
or maybe I shall find the lama and go with him. Yes; that is best. To walk
again as a <i>chela</i> with my lama when he comes back to Benares.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The thoughts came more slowly and disconnectedly. He was plunging into a
beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper, thin and sharp, above the
monotonous babble round the fire. It came from behind the iron-skinned
horse-truck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is not here, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where should he be but roystering in the city. Who looks for a rat in a
frog-pond? Come away. He is not our man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He must not go back beyond the Passes a second time. It is the
order.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hire some woman to drug him. It is a few rupees only, and there is no
evidence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Except the woman. It must be more certain; and remember the price upon
his head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but the police have a long arm, and we are far from the Border. If
it were in Peshawur, now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in Peshawur,&rdquo; the second voice sneered. &ldquo;Peshawur,
full of his blood-kin&mdash;full of bolt-holes and women behind whose clothes
he will hide. Yes, Peshawur or Jehannum would suit us equally well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what is the plan?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O fool, have I not told it a hundred times? Wait till he comes to lie
down, and then one sure shot. The trucks are between us and pursuit. We have
but to run back over the lines and go our way. They will not see whence the
shot came. Wait here at least till the dawn. What manner of <i>faquir</i> art
thou, to shiver at a little watching?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; thought Kim, behind close-shut eyes. &ldquo;Once again it is
Mahbub. Indeed a white stallion&rsquo;s pedigree is not a good thing to peddle
to Sahibs! Or maybe Mahbub has been selling other news. Now what is to do, Kim?
I know not where Mahbub houses, and if he comes here before the dawn they will
shoot him. That would be no profit for thee, Kim. And this is not a matter for
the police. That would be no profit for Mahbub; and&rdquo;&mdash;he giggled
almost aloud&mdash;&ldquo;I do not remember any lesson at Nucklao which will
help me. Allah! Here is Kim and yonder are they. First, then, Kim must wake and
go away, so that they shall not suspect. A bad dream wakes a
man&mdash;thus&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He threw the blanket off his face, and raised himself suddenly with the
terrible, bubbling, meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused by nightmare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Urr-urr-urr-urr! Ya-la-la-la-la! <i>Narain!</i> The <i>churel!</i> The
<i>churel!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A <i>churel</i> is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has died in
child-bed. She haunts lonely roads, her feet are turned backwards on the
ankles, and she leads men to torment.
</p>

<p>
Louder rose Kim&rsquo;s quavering howl, till at last he leaped to his feet and
staggered off sleepily, while the camp cursed him for waking them. Some twenty
yards farther up the line he lay down again, taking care that the whisperers
should hear his grunts and groans as he recomposed himself. After a few minutes
he rolled towards the road and stole away into the thick darkness.
</p>

<p>
He paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert, and dropped behind it, his
chin on a level with the coping-stone. Here he could command all the
night-traffic, himself unseen.
</p>

<p>
Two or three carts passed, jingling out to the suburbs; a coughing policeman
and a hurrying foot-passenger or two who sang to keep off evil spirits. Then
rapped the shod feet of a horse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! This is more like Mahbub,&rdquo; thought Kim, as the beast shied at
the little head above the culvert.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ohé&rdquo;, Mahbub Ali,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;have a care!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The horse was reined back almost on its haunches, and forced towards the
culvert.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never again,&rdquo; said Mahbub, &ldquo;will I take a shod horse for
night-work. They pick up all the bones and nails in the city.&rdquo; He stooped
to lift its forefoot, and that brought his head within a foot of Kim&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Down&mdash;keep down,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The night is full of
eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Two men wait thy coming behind the horse-trucks. They will shoot thee at
thy lying down, because there is a price on thy head. I heard, sleeping near
the horses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didst thou see them? ... Hold still, Sire of Devils!&rdquo; This
furiously to the horse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was one dressed belike as a <i>faquir?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One said to the other, &lsquo;What manner of <i>faquir</i> art thou, to
shiver at a little watching?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good. Go back to the camp and lie down. I do not die tonight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mahbub wheeled his horse and vanished. Kim tore back down the ditch till he
reached a point opposite his second resting-place, slipped across the road like
a weasel, and re-coiled himself in the blanket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At least Mahbub knows,&rdquo; he thought contentedly. &ldquo;And
certainly he spoke as one expecting it. I do not think those two men will
profit by tonight&rsquo;s watch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An hour passed, and, with the best will in the world to keep awake all night,
he slept deeply. Now and again a night train roared along the metals within
twenty feet of him; but he had all the Oriental&rsquo;s indifference to mere
noise, and it did not even weave a dream through his slumber.
</p>

<p>
Mahbub was anything but asleep. It annoyed him vehemently that people outside
his tribe and unaffected by his casual amours should pursue him for the life.
His first and natural impulse was to cross the line lower down, work up again,
and, catching his well-wishers from behind, summarily slay them. Here, he
reflected with sorrow, another branch of the Government, totally unconnected
with Colonel Creighton, might demand explanations which would be hard to
supply; and he knew that south of the Border a perfectly ridiculous fuss is
made about a corpse or so. He had not been troubled in this way since he sent
Kim to Umballa with the message, and hoped that suspicion had been finally
diverted.
</p>

<p>
Then a most brilliant notion struck him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The English do eternally tell the truth,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;therefore we of this country are eternally made foolish. By Allah, I
will tell the truth to an Englishman! Of what use is the Government police if a
poor Kabuli be robbed of his horses in their very trucks. This is as bad as
Peshawur! I should lay a complaint at the station. Better still, some young
Sahib on the Railway! They are zealous, and if they catch thieves it is
remembered to their honour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He tied up his horse outside the station, and strode on to the platform.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, Mahbub Ali&rdquo; said a young Assistant District Traffic
Superintendent who was waiting to go down the line&mdash;a tall, tow-haired,
horsey youth in dingy white linen. &ldquo;What are you doing here? Selling
weeds&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; I am not troubled for my horses. I come to look for Lutuf Ullah. I
have a truck-load up the line. Could anyone take them out without the
Railway&rsquo;s knowledge?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t think so, Mahbub. You can claim against us if they
do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of the trucks
nearly all night. <i>Faquirs</i> do not steal horses, so I gave them no more
thought. I would find Lutuf Ullah, my partner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The deuce you did? And you didn&rsquo;t bother your head about it?
&rsquo;Pon my word, it&rsquo;s just almost as well that I met you. What were
they like, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They were only <i>faquirs</i>. They will no more than take a little
grain, perhaps, from one of the trucks. There are many up the line. The State
will never miss the dole. I came here seeking for my partner, Lutuf
Ullah.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind your partner. Where are your horse-trucks?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little to this side of the farthest place where they make lamps for
the trains.&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The signal-box! Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And upon the rail nearest to the road upon the right-hand
side&mdash;looking up the line thus. But as regards Lutuf Ullah&mdash;a tall
man with a broken nose, and a Persian greyhound Aie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy had hurried off to wake up a young and enthusiastic policeman; for, as
he said, the Railway had suffered much from depredations in the goods-yard.
Mahbub Ali chuckled in his dyed beard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They will walk in their boots, making a noise, and then they will wonder
why there are no <i>faquirs</i>. They are very clever boys&mdash;Barton Sahib
and Young Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He waited idly for a few minutes, expecting to see them hurry up the line girt
for action. A light engine slid through the station, and he caught a glimpse of
young Barton in the cab.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did that child an injustice. He is not altogether a fool,&rdquo; said
Mahbub Ali. &ldquo;To take a fire-carriage for a thief is a new game!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn, no one thought it worth while to
tell him any news of the night. No one, at least, but one small horseboy, newly
advanced to the great man&rsquo;s service, whom Mahbub called to his tiny tent
to assist in some packing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is all known to me,&rdquo; whispered Kim, bending above saddlebags.
&rsquo;Two Sahibs came up on a <i>te-train</i>. I was running to and fro in the
dark on this side of the trucks as the <i>te-train</i> moved up and down
slowly. They fell upon two men sitting under this truck&mdash;Hajji, what shall
I do with this lump of tobacco? Wrap it in paper and put it under the salt-bag?
Yes&mdash;and struck them down. But one man struck at a Sahib with a
<i>faquir&rsquo;s</i> buck&rsquo;s horn&rdquo; (Kim meant the conjoined
black-buck horns, which are a <i>faquir&rsquo;s</i> sole temporal
weapon)&mdash;&ldquo;the blood came. So the other Sahib, first smiting his own
man senseless, smote the stabber with a short gun which had rolled from the
first man&rsquo;s hand. They all raged as though mad together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mahbub smiled with heavenly resignation. &ldquo;No! That is not so much
<i>dewanee</i> (madness, or a case for the civil court&mdash;the word can be
punned upon both ways) as <i>nizamut</i> (a criminal case). A gun, sayest thou?
Ten good years in jail.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then they both lay still, but I think they were nearly dead when they
were put on the <i>te-train</i>. Their heads moved thus. And there is much
blood on the line. Come and see?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have seen blood before. Jail is the sure place&mdash;and assuredly
they will give false names, and assuredly no man will find them for a long
time. They were unfriends of mine. Thy fate and mine seem on one string. What a
tale for the healer of pearls! Now swiftly with the saddle-bags and the
cooking-platter. We will take out the horses and away to Simla.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Swiftly&mdash;as Orientals understand speed&mdash;with long explanations, with
abuse and windy talk, carelessly, amid a hundred checks for little things
forgotten, the untidy camp broke up and led the half-dozen stiff and fretful
horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain-swept dawn. Kim, regarded
as Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s favourite by all who wished to stand well with the
Pathan, was not called upon to work. They strolled on by the easiest of stages,
halting every few hours at a wayside shelter. Very many Sahibs travel along the
Kalka road; and, as Mahbub Ali says, every young Sahib must needs esteem
himself a judge of a horse, and, though he be over head in debt to the
money-lender, must make as if to buy. That was the reason that Sahib after
Sahib, rolling along in a stage-carriage, would stop and open talk. Some would
even descend from their vehicles and feel the horses&rsquo; legs; asking inane
questions, or, through sheer ignorance of the vernacular, grossly insulting the
imperturbable trader.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When first I dealt with Sahibs, and that was when Colonel Soady Sahib
was Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the Commissioner&rsquo;s camping-ground
for spite,&rdquo; Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy filled his pipe under a
tree, &ldquo;I did not know how greatly they were fools, and this made me
wroth. As thus&mdash;,&rdquo; and he told Kim a tale of an expression, misused
in all innocence, that doubled Kim up with mirth. &ldquo;Now I see,
however,&rdquo;&mdash;he exhaled smoke slowly&mdash;&ldquo;that it is with them
as with all men&mdash;in certain matters they are wise, and in others most
foolish. Very foolish it is to use the wrong word to a stranger; for though the
heart may be clean of offence, how is the stranger to know that? He is more
like to search truth with a dagger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True. True talk,&rdquo; said Kim solemnly. &ldquo;Fools speak of a cat
when a woman is brought to bed, for instance. I have heard them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Therefore, in one situate as thou art, it particularly behoves thee to
remember this with both kinds of faces. Among Sahibs, never forgetting thou art
a Sahib; among the folk of Hind, always remembering thou art&mdash;&rdquo; He
paused, with a puzzled smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist? That is a hard
knot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou art beyond question an unbeliever, and therefore thou wilt be
damned. So says my Law&mdash;or I think it does. But thou art also my Little
Friend of all the World, and I love thee. So says my heart. This matter of
creeds is like horseflesh. The wise man knows horses are good&mdash;that there
is a profit to be made from all; and for myself&mdash;but that I am a good
Sunni and hate the men of Tirah&mdash;I could believe the same of all the
Faiths. Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare taken from the sands of her birthplace
and removed to the west of Bengal founders&mdash;nor is even a Balkh stallion
(and there are no better horses than those of Balkh, were they not so heavy in
the shoulder) of any account in the great Northern deserts beside the
snow-camels I have seen. Therefore I say in my heart the Faiths are like the
horses. Each has merit in its own country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But my lama said altogether a different thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal. My heart is a little
angry, Friend of all the World, that thou shouldst see such worth in a man so
little known.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is true, Hajji; but that worth do I see, and to him my heart is
drawn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And his to thine, I hear. Hearts are like horses. They come and they go
against bit or spur. Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive in that bay
stallion&rsquo;s pickets more firmly. We do not want a horse-fight at every
resting-stage, and the dun and the black will be locked in a little ... Now
hear me. Is it necessary to the comfort of thy heart to see that lama?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is one part of my bond,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;If I do not see him,
and if he is taken from me, I will go out of that <i>madrissah</i> in Nucklao
and, and&mdash;once gone, who is to find me again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is true. Never was colt held on a lighter heel-rope than thou.&rdquo;
Mahbub nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not be afraid.&rdquo; Kim spoke as though he could have vanished on
the moment. &ldquo;My lama has said that he will come to see me at the
<i>madrissah</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A beggar and his bowl in the presence of those young Sa&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not all!&rdquo; Kim cut in with a snort. &ldquo;Their eyes are blued and
their nails are blackened with low-caste blood, many of them. Sons of
<i>mehteeranees</i>&mdash;brothers-in-law to the <i>bhungi</i>
(sweeper).&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We need not follow the rest of the pedigree; but Kim made his little point
clearly and without heat, chewing a piece of sugar-cane the while.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Friend of all the World,&rdquo; said Mahbub, pushing over the pipe for
the boy to clean, &ldquo;I have met many men, women, and boys, and not a few
Sahibs. I have never in all my days met such an imp as thou art.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why? When I always tell thee the truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps the very reason, for this is a world of danger to honest
men.&rdquo; Mahbub Ali hauled himself off the ground, girt in his belt, and
went over to the horses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or sell it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was that in the tone that made Mahbub halt and turn. &ldquo;What new
devilry?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eight annas, and I will tell,&rdquo; said Kim, grinning. &ldquo;It
touches thy peace.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Shaitan!&rdquo; Mahbub gave the money.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rememberest thou the little business of the thieves in the dark, down
yonder at Umballa?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seeing they sought my life, I have not altogether forgotten. Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rememberest thou the Kashmir Serai?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will twist thy ears in a moment&mdash;Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No need&mdash;Pathan. Only, the second <i>faquir</i>, whom the Sahibs
beat senseless, was the man who came to search thy bulkhead at Lahore. I saw
his face as they helped him on the engine. The very same man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didst thou not tell before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he will go to jail, and be safe for some years. There is no need to
tell more than is necessary at any one time. Besides, I did not then need money
for sweetmeats.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah kerim!&rdquo; said Mahbub Ah. &ldquo;Wilt thou some day sell my
head for a few sweetmeats if the fit takes thee?&rdquo;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Kim will remember till he dies that long, lazy journey from Umballa, through
Kalka and the Pinjore Gardens near by, up to Simla. A sudden spate in the
Gugger River swept down one horse (the most valuable, be sure), and nearly
drowned Kim among the dancing boulders. Farther up the road the horses were
stampeded by a Government elephant, and being in high condition of grass food,
it cost a day and a half to get them together again. Then they met Sikandar
Khan coming down with a few unsaleable screws&mdash;remnants of his
string&mdash;and Mahbub, who has more of horse-coping in his little fingernail
than Sikandar Khan in all his tents, must needs buy two of the worst, and that
meant eight hours&rsquo; laborious diplomacy and untold tobacco. But it was all
pure delight&mdash;the wandering road, climbing, dipping, and sweeping about
the growing spurs; the flush of the morning laid along the distant snows; the
branched cacti, tier upon tier on the stony hillsides; the voices of a thousand
water-channels; the chatter of the monkeys; the solemn deodars, climbing one
after another with down-drooped branches; the vista of the Plains rolled out
far beneath them; the incessant twanging of the tonga-horns and the wild rush
of the led horses when a tonga swung round a curve; the halts for prayers
(Mahbub was very religious in dry-washings and bellowings when time did not
press); the evening conferences by the halting-places, when camels and bullocks
chewed solemnly together and the stolid drivers told the news of the
Road&mdash;all these things lifted Kim&rsquo;s heart to song within him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, when the singing and dancing is done,&rdquo; said Mahbub Ali,
&ldquo;comes the Colonel Sahib&rsquo;s, and that is not so sweet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fair land&mdash;a most beautiful land is this of Hind&mdash;and the
land of the Five Rivers is fairer than all,&rdquo; Kim half chanted.
&ldquo;Into it I will go again if Mahbub Ali or the Colonel lift hand or foot
against me. Once gone, who shall find me? Look, Hajji, is yonder the city of
Simla? Allah, what a city!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s brother, and he was an old man when Mackerson
Sahib&rsquo;s well was new at Peshawur, could recall when there were but two
houses in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He led the horses below the main road into the lower Simla bazar&mdash;the
crowded rabbit-warren that climbs up from the valley to the Town Hall at an
angle of forty-five. A man who knows his way there can defy all the police of
India&rsquo;s summer capital, so cunningly does veranda communicate with
veranda, alley-way with alley-way, and bolt-hole with bolt-hole. Here live
those who minister to the wants of the glad city&mdash;jhampanis who pull the
pretty ladies&rsquo; &ldquo;rickshaws by night and gamble till the dawn;
grocers, oil-sellers, curio-vendors, firewood-dealers, priests, pickpockets,
and native employees of the Government. Here are discussed by courtesans the
things which are supposed to be profoundest secrets of the India Council; and
here gather all the sub-sub-agents of half the Native States. Here, too, Mahbub
Ali rented a room, much more securely locked than his bulkhead at Lahore, in
the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer. It was a place of miracles, too, for
there went in at twilight a Mohammedan horseboy, and there came out an hour
later a Eurasian lad&mdash;the Lucknow girl&rsquo;s dye was of the
best&mdash;in badly-fitting shop-clothes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have spoken with Creighton Sahib,&rdquo; quoth Mahbub Ali, &ldquo;and
a second time has the Hand of Friendship averted the Whip of Calamity. He says
that thou hast altogether wasted sixty days upon the Road, and it is too late,
therefore, to send thee to any Hill-school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have said that my holidays are my own. I do not go to school twice
over. That is one part of my bond.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Colonel Sahib is not yet aware of that contract. Thou art to lodge
in Lurgan Sahib&rsquo;s house till it is time to go again to Nucklao.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had sooner lodge with thee, Mahbub.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou dost not know the honour. Lurgan Sahib himself asked for thee. Thou
wilt go up the hill and along the road atop, and there thou must forget for a
while that thou hast ever seen or spoken to me, Mahbub Ali, who sells horses to
Creighton Sahib, whom thou dost not know. Remember this order.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim nodded. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and who is Lurgan Sahib?
Nay&rdquo;&mdash;he caught Mahbub&rsquo;s sword-keen glance&mdash;&ldquo;indeed
I have never heard his name. Is he by chance&mdash;he lowered his
voice&mdash;&ldquo;one of us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What talk is this of <i>us</i>, Sahib?&rdquo; Mahbub Ali returned, in
the tone he used towards Europeans. &ldquo;I am a Pathan; thou art a Sahib and
the son of a Sahib. Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the European shops. All Simla
knows it. Ask there ... and, Friend of all the World, he is one to be obeyed to
the last wink of his eyelashes. Men say he does magic, but that should not
touch thee. Go up the hill and ask. Here begins the Great Game.&rdquo;

</p>

<p>
Kim flung himself whole-heartedly upon the next turn of the wheel. He would be
a Sahib again for a while. In that idea, so soon as he had reached the broad
road under Simla Town Hall, he cast about for one to impress. A Hindu child,
some ten years old, squatted under a lamp-post.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is Mr Lurgan&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; demanded Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not understand English,&rdquo; was the answer, and Kim shifted his
speech accordingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will show.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Together they set off through the mysterious dusk, full of the noises of a city
below the hillside, and the breath of a cool wind in deodar-crowned Jakko,
shouldering the stars. The house-lights, scattered on every level, made, as it
were, a double firmament. Some were fixed, others belonged to the
&ldquo;rickshaws of the careless, open-spoken English folk, going out to
dinner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; said Kim&rsquo;s guide, and halted in a veranda flush
with the main road. No door stayed them, but a curtain of beaded reeds that
split up the lamplight beyond.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is come,&rdquo; said the boy, in a voice little louder than a sigh,
and vanished. Kim felt sure that the boy had been posted to guide him from the
first, but, putting a bold face on it, parted the curtain. A black-bearded man,
with a green shade over his eyes, sat at a table, and, one by one, with short,
white hands, picked up globules of light from a tray before him, threaded them
on a glancing silken string, and hummed to himself the while. Kim was conscious
that beyond the circle of light the room was full of things that smelt like all
the temples of all the East. A whiff of musk, a puff of sandal-wood, and a
breath of sickly jessamine-oil caught his opened nostrils.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; said Kim at last, speaking in the vernacular: the
smells made him forget that he was to be a Sahib.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one,&rdquo; the man counted to himself,
stringing pearl after pearl so quickly that Kim could scarcely follow his
fingers. He slid off the green shade and looked fixedly at Kim for a full
half-minute. The pupils of the eye dilated and closed to pin-pricks, as if at
will. There was a <i>faquir</i> by the Taksali Gate who had just this gift and
made money by it, especially when cursing silly women. Kim stared with
interest. His disreputable friend could further twitch his ears, almost like a
goat, and Kim was disappointed that this new man could not imitate him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; said Lurgan Sahib suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I fear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou wilt sleep here tonight, and stay with me till it is time to go
again to Nucklao. It is an order.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is an order,&rdquo; Kim repeated. &ldquo;But where shall I
sleep?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, in this room.&rdquo; Lurgan Sahib waved his hand towards the
darkness behind him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Kim composedly. &ldquo;Now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He nodded and held the lamp above his head. As the light swept them, there
leaped out from the walls a collection of Tibetan devil-dance masks, hanging
above the fiend-embroidered draperies of those ghastly functions&mdash;horned
masks, scowling masks, and masks of idiotic terror. In a corner, a Japanese
warrior, mailed and plumed, menaced him with a halberd, and a score of lances
and <i>khandas</i> and <i>kuttars</i> gave back the unsteady gleam. But what
interested Kim more than all these things&mdash;he had seen devil-dance masks
at the Lahore Museum&mdash;was a glimpse of the soft-eyed Hindu child who had
left him in the doorway, sitting cross-legged under the table of pearls with a
little smile on his scarlet lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that Lurgan Sahib wishes to make me afraid. And I am sure that
that devil&rsquo;s brat below the table wishes to see me afraid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This place,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;is like a Wonder House. Where
is my bed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lurgan Sahib pointed to a native quilt in a corner by the loathsome masks,
picked up the lamp, and left the room black.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was that Lurgan Sahib?&rdquo; Kim asked as he cuddled down. No answer.
He could hear the Hindu boy breathing, however, and, guided by the sound,
crawled across the floor, and cuffed into the darkness, crying: &ldquo;Give
answer, devil! Is this the way to lie to a Sahib?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
From the darkness he fancied he could hear the echo of a chuckle. It could not
be his soft-fleshed companion, because he was weeping. So Kim lifted up his
voice and called aloud:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lurgan Sahib! O Lurgan Sahib! Is it an order that thy servant does not
speak to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is an order.&rdquo; The voice came from behind him and he started.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good. But remember,&rdquo; he muttered, as he resought the quilt,
&ldquo;I will beat thee in the morning. I do not love Hindus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was no cheerful night; the room being overfull of voices and music. Kim
was waked twice by someone calling his name. The second time he set out in
search, and ended by bruising his nose against a box that certainly spoke with
a human tongue, but in no sort of human accent. It seemed to end in a tin
trumpet and to be joined by wires to a smaller box on the floor&mdash;so far,
at least, as he could judge by touch. And the voice, very hard and whirring,
came out of the trumpet. Kim rubbed his nose and grew furious, thinking, as
usual, in Hindi.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This with a beggar from the bazar might be good, but&mdash;I am a Sahib
and the son of a Sahib and, which is twice as much more beside, a student of
Nucklao. Yess&rdquo; (here he turned to English), &ldquo;a boy of St
Xavier&rsquo;s. Damn Mr Lurgan&rsquo;s eyes!&mdash;It is some sort of machinery
like a sewing-machine. Oh, it is a <i>great</i> cheek of him&mdash;we are not
frightened that way at Lucknow&mdash;No!&rdquo; Then in Hindi: &ldquo;But what
does <i>he</i> gain? He is only a trader&mdash;I am in his shop. But Creighton
Sahib is a Colonel&mdash;and I think Creighton Sahib gave orders that it should
be done. <i>How</i> I will beat that Hindu in the morning! What is this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The trumpet-box was pouring out a string of the most elaborate abuse that even
Kim had ever heard, in a high uninterested voice, that for a moment lifted the
short hairs of his neck. When the vile thing drew breath, Kim was reassured by
the soft, sewing-machine-like whirr.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Chûp!</i> (Be still)&rdquo; he cried, and again he heard a chuckle
that decided him. &ldquo;<i>Chûp</i>&mdash;or I break your head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The box took no heed. Kim wrenched at the tin trumpet and something lifted with
a click. He had evidently raised a lid. If there were a devil inside, now was
its time, for&mdash;he sniffed&mdash;thus did the sewing-machines of the bazar
smell. He would clean that <i>shaitan</i>. He slipped off his jacket, and
plunged it into the box&rsquo;s mouth. Something long and round bent under the
pressure, there was a whirr and the voice stopped&mdash;as voices must if you
ram a thrice-doubled coat on to the wax cylinder and into the works of an
expensive phonograph. Kim finished his slumbers with a serene mind.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he was aware of Lurgan Sahib looking down on him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah!&rdquo; said Kim, firmly resolved to cling to his Sahib-dom.
&ldquo;There was a box in the night that gave me bad talk. So I stopped it. Was
it your box?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shake hands, O&rsquo;Hara,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, it was my box. I
keep such things because my friends the Rajahs like them. That one is broken,
but it was cheap at the price. Yes, my friends, the Kings, are very fond of
toys&mdash;and so am I sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim looked him over out of the corners of his eyes. He was a Sahib in that he
wore Sahib&rsquo;s clothes; the accent of his Urdu, the intonation of his
English, showed that he was anything but a Sahib. He seemed to understand what
moved in Kim&rsquo;s mind ere the boy opened his mouth, and he took no pains to
explain himself as did Father Victor or the Lucknow masters. Sweetest of
all&mdash;he treated Kim as an equal on the Asiatic side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sorry you cannot beat my boy this morning. He says he will kill you
with a knife or poison. He is jealous, so I have put him in the corner and I
shall not speak to him today. He has just tried to kill me. You must help me
with the breakfast. He is almost too jealous to trust, just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a great to-do over
this tale. Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as Mahbub Ali was used to record
his little affairs in the North.
</p>

<p>
The back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer hillside, and they
looked down into their neighbours&rsquo; chimney-pots, as is the custom of
Simla. But even more than the purely Persian meal cooked by Lurgan Sahib with
his own hands, the shop fascinated Kim. The Lahore Museum was larger, but here
were more wonders&mdash;ghost-daggers and prayer-wheels from Tibet; turquoise
and raw amber necklaces; green jade bangles; curiously packed incense-sticks in
jars crusted over with raw garnets; the devil-masks of overnight and a wall
full of peacock-blue draperies; gilt figures of Buddha, and little portable
lacquer altars; Russian samovars with turquoises on the lid; egg-shell china
sets in quaint octagonal cane boxes; yellow ivory crucifixes&mdash;from Japan
of all places in the world, so Lurgan Sahib said; carpets in dusty bales,
smelling atrociously, pushed back behind torn and rotten screens of geometrical
work; Persian water-jugs for the hands after meals; dull copper incense-burners
neither Chinese nor Persian, with friezes of fantastic devils running round
them; tarnished silver belts that knotted like raw hide; hairpins of jade,
ivory, and plasma; arms of all sorts and kinds, and a thousand other oddments
were cased, or piled, or merely thrown into the room, leaving a clear space
only round the rickety deal table, where Lurgan Sahib worked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those things are nothing,&rdquo; said his host, following Kim&rsquo;s
glance. &ldquo;I buy them because they are pretty, and sometimes I
sell&mdash;if I like the buyer&rsquo;s look. My work is on the table&mdash;some
of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It blazed in the morning light&mdash;all red and blue and green flashes, picked
out with the vicious blue-white spurt of a diamond here and there. Kim opened
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, they are quite well, those stones. It will not hurt them to take the
sun. Besides, they are cheap. But with sick stones it is very different.&rdquo;
He piled Kim&rsquo;s plate anew. &ldquo;There is no one but <i>me</i> can
doctor a sick pearl and re-blue turquoises. I grant you opals&mdash;any fool
can cure an opal&mdash;but for a sick pearl there is only me. Suppose I were to
die! Then there would be no one ... Oh no! <i>You</i> cannot do anything with
jewels. It will be quite enough if you understand a little about the
Turquoise&mdash;some day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He moved to the end of the veranda to refill the heavy, porous clay water-jug
from the filter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you want drink?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim nodded. Lurgan Sahib, fifteen feet off, laid one hand on the jar. Next
instant, it stood at Kim&rsquo;s elbow, full to within half an inch of the
brim&mdash;the white cloth only showing, by a small wrinkle, where it had slid
into place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wah!&rdquo; said Kim in most utter amazement. &ldquo;That is
magic.&rdquo; Lurgan Sahib&rsquo;s smile showed that the compliment had gone
home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Throw it back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will break.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, throw it back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim pitched it at random. It fell short and crashed into fifty pieces, while
the water dripped through the rough veranda boarding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said it would break.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All one. Look at it. Look at the largest piece.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That lay with a sparkle of water in its curve, as it were a star on the floor.
Kim looked intently. Lurgan Sahib laid one hand gently on the nape of his neck,
stroked it twice or thrice, and whispered: &ldquo;Look! It shall come to life
again, piece by piece. First the big piece shall join itself to two others on
the right and the left&mdash;on the right and the left. Look!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To save his life, Kim could not have turned his head. The light touch held him
as in a vice, and his blood tingled pleasantly through him. There was one large
piece of the jar where there had been three, and above them the shadowy outline
of the entire vessel. He could see the veranda through it, but it was
thickening and darkening with each beat of his pulse. Yet the jar&mdash;how
slowly the thoughts came!&mdash;the jar had been smashed before his eyes.
Another wave of prickling fire raced down his neck, as Lurgan Sahib moved his
hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look! It is coming into shape,&rdquo; said Lurgan Sahib.
</p>

<p>
So far Kim had been thinking in Hindi, but a tremor came on him, and with an
effort like that of a swimmer before sharks, who hurls himself half out of the
water, his mind leaped up from a darkness that was swallowing it and took
refuge in&mdash;the multiplication-table in English!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look! It is coming into shape,&rdquo; whispered Lurgan Sahib.
</p>

<p>
The jar had been smashed&mdash;yess, smashed&mdash;not the native word, he
would not think of that&mdash;but smashed&mdash;into fifty pieces, and twice
three was six, and thrice three was nine, and four times three was twelve. He
clung desperately to the repetition. The shadow-outline of the jar cleared like
a mist after rubbing eyes. There were the broken shards; there was the spilt
water drying in the sun, and through the cracks of the veranda showed, all
ribbed, the white house-wall below&mdash;and thrice twelve was thirty-six!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look! Is it coming into shape?&rdquo; asked Lurgan Sahib.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it is smashed&mdash;smashed,&rdquo; he gasped&mdash;Lurgan Sahib had
been muttering softly for the last half-minute. Kim wrenched his head aside.
&ldquo;Look! <i>Dekho!</i> It is there as it was there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is there as it was there,&rdquo; said Lurgan, watching Kim closely
while the boy rubbed his neck. &ldquo;But you are the first of many who has
ever seen it so.&rdquo; He wiped his broad forehead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was that more magic?&rdquo; Kim asked suspiciously. The tingle had gone
from his veins; he felt unusually wide awake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, that was not magic. It was only to see if there was&mdash;a flaw in
a jewel. Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if a man holds them
in his hand, and knows the proper way. That is why one must be careful before
one sets them. Tell me, did you see the shape of the pot?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For a little time. It began to grow like a flower from the
ground.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then what did you do? I mean, how did you think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah! I knew it was broken, and so, I think, that was what I
thought&mdash;and it was broken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hm! Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it was,&rdquo; said Kim &ldquo;do you think I should let it again? I
should run away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now you are not afraid&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lurgan Sahib looked at him more closely than ever. &ldquo;I shall ask Mahbub
Ali&mdash;not now, but some day later,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I am pleased
with you&mdash;yes; and I am pleased with you&mdash;no. You are the first that
ever saved himself. I wish I knew what it was that ... But you are right. You
should not tell that&mdash;not even to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned into the dusky gloom of the shop, and sat down at the table, rubbing
his hands softly. A small, husky sob came from behind a pile of carpets. It was
the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall. His thin shoulders worked
with grief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! He is jealous, so jealous. I wonder if he will try to poison me
again in my breakfast, and make me cook it twice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Kubbee</i>&mdash;<i>kubbee nahin,</i>&rdquo; came the broken answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And whether he will kill this other boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Kubbee&mdash;kubbee nahin.</i>&rdquo; (Never&mdash;never. No!)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do <i>you</i> think he will do?&rdquo; He turned suddenly on Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah! I do not know. Let him go, perhaps. Why did he want to poison
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because he is so fond of me. Suppose you were fond of someone, and you
saw someone come, and the man you were fond of was more pleased with him than
he was with you, what would you do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim thought. Lurgan repeated the sentence slowly in the vernacular.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should not poison that man,&rdquo; said Kim reflectively, &ldquo;but I
should beat that boy&mdash;<i>if</i> that boy was fond of my man. But first, I
would ask that boy if it were true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! He thinks everyone must be fond of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I think he is a fool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hearest thou?&rdquo; said Lurgan Sahib to the shaking shoulders.
&ldquo;The Sahib&rsquo;s son thinks thou art a little fool. Come out, and next
time thy heart is troubled, do not try white arsenic quite so openly. Surely
the Devil Dasim was lord of our table-cloth that day! It might have made me
ill, child, and then a stranger would have guarded the jewels. Come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The child, heavy-eyed with much weeping, crept out from behind the bale and
flung himself passionately at Lurgan Sahib&rsquo;s feet, with an extravagance
of remorse that impressed even Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will look into the ink-pools&mdash;I will faithfully guard the jewels!
Oh, my Father and my Mother, send <i>him</i> away!&rdquo; He indicated Kim with
a backward jerk of his bare heel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;not yet. In a little while he will go away again. But now
he is at school&mdash;at a new <i>madrissah</i>&mdash;and thou shalt be his
teacher. Play the Play of the Jewels against him. I will keep tally.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The child dried his tears at once, and dashed to the back of the shop, whence
he returned with a copper tray.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me!&rdquo; he said to Lurgan Sahib. &ldquo;Let them come from thy
hand, for he may say that I knew them before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gently&mdash;gently,&rdquo; the man replied, and from a drawer under the
table dealt a half-handful of clattering trifles into the tray.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the child, waving an old newspaper. &ldquo;Look on them
as long as thou wilt, stranger. Count and, if need be, handle. One look is
enough for <i>me</i>.&rdquo; He turned his back proudly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what is the game?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When thou hast counted and handled and art sure that thou canst remember
them all, I cover them with this paper, and thou must tell over the tally to
Lurgan Sahib. <i>I</i> will write mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah!&rdquo; The instinct of competition waked in his breast. He bent
over the tray. There were but fifteen stones on it. &ldquo;That is easy,&rdquo;
he said after a minute. The child slipped the paper over the winking jewels and
scribbled in a native account-book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are under that paper five blue stones&mdash;one big, one smaller,
and three small,&rdquo; said Kim, all in haste. &ldquo;There are four green
stones, and one with a hole in it; there is one yellow stone that I can see
through, and one like a pipe-stem. There are two red stones,
and&mdash;and&mdash;I made the count fifteen, but two I have forgotten. No!
Give me time. One was of ivory, little and brownish; and&mdash;and&mdash;give
me time...&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One&mdash;two&rdquo;&mdash;Lurgan Sahib counted him out up to ten. Kim
shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear my count!&rdquo; the child burst in, trilling with laughter.
&ldquo;First, are two flawed sapphires&mdash;one of two ruttees and one of four
as I should judge. The four-ruttee sapphire is chipped at the edge. There is
one Turkestan turquoise, plain with black veins, and there are two
inscribed&mdash;one with a Name of God in gilt, and the other being cracked
across, for it came out of an old ring, I cannot read. We have now all five
blue stones. Four flawed emeralds there are, but one is drilled in two places,
and one is a little carven&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Their weights?&rdquo; said Lurgan Sahib impassively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three&mdash;five&mdash;five&mdash;and four ruttees as I judge it. There
is one piece of old greenish pipe amber, and a cut topaz from Europe. There is
one ruby of Burma, of two ruttees, without a flaw, and there is a balas-ruby,
flawed, of two ruttees. There is a carved ivory from China representing a rat
sucking an egg; and there is last&mdash;ah ha!&mdash;a ball of crystal as big
as a bean set on a gold leaf.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He clapped his hands at the close.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is thy master,&rdquo; said Lurgan Sahib, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Huh! He knew the names of the stones,&rdquo; said Kim, flushing.
&ldquo;Try again! With common things such as he and I both know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They heaped the tray again with odds and ends gathered from the shop, and even
the kitchen, and every time the child won, till Kim marvelled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bind my eyes&mdash;let me feel once with my fingers, and even
<i>then</i> I will leave thee opened-eyed behind,&rdquo; he challenged.
</p>

<p>
Kim stamped with vexation when the lad made his boast good.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it were men&mdash;or horses,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I could do
better. This playing with tweezers and knives and scissors is too
little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Learn first&mdash;teach later,&rdquo; said Lurgan Sahib. &ldquo;Is he
thy master?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Truly. But how is it done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By doing it many times over till it is done perfectly&mdash;for it is
worth doing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Hindu boy, in highest feather, actually patted Kim on the back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not despair,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I myself will teach thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I will see that thou art well taught,&rdquo; said Lurgan Sahib,
still speaking in the vernacular, &ldquo;for except my boy here&mdash;it was
foolish of him to buy so much white arsenic when, if he had asked, I could have
given it&mdash;except my boy here I have not in a long time met with one better
worth teaching. And there are ten days more ere thou canst return to Lucknao
where they teach nothing&mdash;at the long price. We shall, I think, be
friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were a most mad ten days, but Kim enjoyed himself too much to reflect on
their craziness. In the morning they played the Jewel Game&mdash;sometimes with
veritable stones, sometimes with piles of swords and daggers, sometimes with
photo-graphs of natives. Through the afternoons he and the Hindu boy would
mount guard in the shop, sitting dumb behind a carpet-bale or a screen and
watching Mr Lurgan&rsquo;s many and very curious visitors. There were small
Rajahs, escorts coughing in the veranda, who came to buy curiosities&mdash;such
as phonographs and mechanical toys. There were ladies in search of necklaces,
and men, it seemed to Kim&mdash;but his mind may have been vitiated by early
training&mdash;in search of the ladies; natives from independent and feudatory
Courts whose ostensible business was the repair of broken
necklaces&mdash;rivers of light poured out upon the table&mdash;but whose true
end seemed to be to raise money for angry Maharanees or young Rajahs. There
were Babus to whom Lurgan Sahib talked with austerity and authority, but at the
end of each interview he gave them money in coined silver and currency notes.
There were occasional gatherings of long-coated theatrical natives who
discussed metaphysics in English and Bengali, to Mr Lurgan&rsquo;s great
edification. He was always interested in religions. At the end of the day, Kim
and the Hindu boy&mdash;whose name varied at Lurgan&rsquo;s pleasure&mdash;were
expected to give a detailed account of all that they had seen and
heard&mdash;their view of each man&rsquo;s character, as shown in his face,
talk, and manner, and their notions of his real errand. After dinner, Lurgan
Sahib&rsquo;s fancy turned more to what might be called dressing-up, in which
game he took a most informing interest. He could paint faces to a marvel; with
a brush-dab here and a line there changing them past recognition. The shop was
full of all manner of dresses and turbans, and Kim was apparelled variously as
a young Mohammedan of good family, an oilman, and once&mdash;which was a joyous
evening&mdash;as the son of an Oudh landholder in the fullest of full dress.
Lurgan Sahib had a hawk&rsquo;s eye to detect the least flaw in the make-up;
and lying on a worn teak-wood couch, would explain by the half-hour together
how such and such a caste talked, or walked, or coughed, or spat, or sneezed,
and, since &ldquo;hows&rdquo; matter little in this world, the
&ldquo;why&rdquo; of everything. The Hindu child played this game clumsily.
That little mind, keen as an icicle where tally of jewels was concerned, could
not temper itself to enter another&rsquo;s soul; but a demon in Kim woke up and
sang with joy as he put on the changing dresses, and changed speech and gesture
therewith.
</p>

<p>
Carried away by enthusiasm, he volunteered to show Lurgan Sahib one evening how
the disciples of a certain caste of <i>faquir</i>, old Lahore acquaintances,
begged doles by the roadside; and what sort of language he would use to an
Englishman, to a Punjabi farmer going to a fair, and to a woman without a veil.
Lurgan Sahib laughed immensely, and begged Kim to stay as he was, immobile for
half an hour&mdash;cross-legged, ash-smeared, and wild-eyed, in the back room.
At the end of that time entered a hulking, obese Babu whose stockinged legs
shook with fat, and Kim opened on him with a shower of wayside chaff. Lurgan
Sahib&mdash;this annoyed Kim&mdash;watched the Babu and not the play.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the Babu heavily, lighting a cigarette, &ldquo;I am
of opeenion that it is most extraordinary and effeecient performance. Except
that you had told me I should have opined that&mdash;that&mdash;that you were
pulling my legs. How soon can he become approximately effeecient chain-man?
Because <i>then</i> I shall indent for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is what he must learn at Lucknow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then order him to be jolly-dam&rsquo;-quick. Good-night, Lurgan.&rdquo;
The Babu swung out with the gait of a bogged cow.
</p>

<p>
When they were telling over the day&rsquo;s list of visitors, Lurgan Sahib
asked Kim who he thought the man might be.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; said Kim cheerily. The tone might almost have deceived
Mahbub Ali, but it failed entirely with the healer of sick pearls.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is true. God, He knows; but I wish to know what you think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim glanced sideways at his companion, whose eye had a way of compelling truth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I think he will want me when I come from the school,
but&rdquo;&mdash;confidentially, as Lurgan Sahib nodded approval&mdash;&ldquo;I
do not understand how <i>he</i> can wear many dresses and talk many
tongues.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou wilt understand many things later. He is a writer of tales for a
certain Colonel. His honour is great only in Simla, and it is noticeable that
he has no name, but only a number and a letter&mdash;that is a custom among
us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And is there a price upon his head too&mdash;as upon Mah&mdash;all the
others?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not yet; but if a boy rose up who is now sitting here and
went&mdash;look, the door is open!&mdash;as far as a certain house with a
red-painted veranda, behind that which was the old theatre in the Lower Bazar,
and whispered through the shutters: &lsquo;Hurree Chunder Mookerjee bore the
bad news of last month&rsquo;, that boy might take away a belt full of
rupees.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; said Kim promptly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Five hundred&mdash;a thousand&mdash;as many as he might ask for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good. And for how long might such a boy live after the news was
told?&rdquo; He smiled merrily at Lurgan&rsquo;s Sahib&rsquo;s very beard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! That is to be well thought of. Perhaps if he were very clever, he
might live out the day&mdash;but not the night. By no means the night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what is the Babu&rsquo;s pay if so much is put upon his
head?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eighty&mdash;perhaps a hundred&mdash;perhaps a hundred and fifty rupees;
but the pay is the least part of the work. From time to time, God causes men to
be born&mdash;and thou art one of them&mdash;who have a lust to go abroad at
the risk of their lives and discover news&mdash;today it may be of far-off
things, tomorrow of some hidden mountain, and the next day of some near-by men
who have done a foolishness against the State. These souls are very few; and of
these few, not more than ten are of the best. Among these ten I count the Babu,
and that is curious. How great, therefore, and desirable must be a business
that brazens the heart of a Bengali!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True. But the days go slowly for me. I am yet a boy, and it is only
within two months I learned to write Angrezi. Even now I cannot read it well.
And there are yet years and years and long years before I can be even a
chain-man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have patience, Friend of all the World&rdquo;&mdash;Kim started at the
title. &ldquo;Would I had a few of the years that so irk thee. I have proved
thee in several small ways. This will not be forgotten when I make my report to
the Colonel Sahib.&rdquo; Then, changing suddenly into English with a deep
laugh:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove! O&rsquo;Hara, I think there is a great deal in you; but you
must not become proud and you must not talk. You must go back to Lucknow and be
a good little boy and mind your book, as the English say, and perhaps, next
holidays if you care, you can come back to me!&rdquo; Kim&rsquo;s face fell.
&ldquo;Oh, I mean <i>if</i> you like. I know where you want to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Four days later a seat was booked for Kim and his small trunk at the rear of a
Kalka tonga. His companion was the whale-like Babu, who, with a fringed shawl
wrapped round his head, and his fat openwork-stockinged left leg tucked under
him, shivered and grunted in the morning chill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How comes it that this man is one of <i>us?</i>&rdquo; thought Kim
considering the jelly back as they jolted down the road; and the reflection
threw him into most pleasant day-dreams. Lurgan Sahib had given him five
rupees&mdash;a splendid sum&mdash;as well as the assurance of his protection if
he worked. Unlike Mahbub, Lurgan Sahib had spoken most explicitly of the reward
that would follow obedience, and Kim was content. If only, like the Babu, he
could enjoy the dignity of a letter and a number&mdash;and a price upon his
head! Some day he would be all that and more. Some day he might be almost as
great as Mahbub Ali! The housetops of his search should be half India; he would
follow Kings and Ministers, as in the old days he had followed <i>vakils</i>
and lawyers&rsquo; touts across Lahore city for Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s sake.
Meantime, there was the present, and not at all unpleasant, fact of St
Xavier&rsquo;s immediately before him. There would be new boys to condescend
to, and there would be tales of holiday adventures to hear. Young Martin, son
of the tea-planter at Manipur, had boasted that he would go to war, with a
rifle, against the head-hunters.
</p>

<p>
That might be, but it was certain young Martin had not been blown half across
the forecourt of a Patiala palace by an explosion of fireworks; nor had he...
Kim fell to telling himself the story of his own adventures through the last
three months. He could paralyse St Xavier&rsquo;s&mdash;even the biggest boys
who shaved&mdash;with the recital, were that permitted. But it was, of course,
out of the question. There would be a price upon his head in good time, as
Lurgan Sahib had assured him; and if he talked foolishly now, not only would
that price never be set, but Colonel Creighton would cast him off&mdash;and he
would be left to the wrath of Lurgan Sahib and Mahbub Ali&mdash;for the short
space of life that would remain to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I should lose Delhi for the sake of a fish,&rdquo; was his proverbial
philosophy. It behoved him to forget his holidays (there would always remain
the fun of inventing imaginary adventures) and, as Lurgan Sahib had said, to
work. Of all the boys hurrying back to St Xavier&rsquo;s, from Sukkur in the
sands to Galle beneath the palms, none was so filled with virtue as Kimball
O&rsquo;Hara, jiggeting down to Umballa behind Hurree Chunder Mookerjee, whose
name on the books of one section of the Ethnological Survey was R.17.
</p>

<p>
And if additional spur were needed, the Babu supplied it. After a huge meal at
Kalka, he spoke uninterruptedly. Was Kim going to school? Then he, an M A of
Calcutta University, would explain the advantages of education. There were
marks to be gained by due attention to Latin and Wordsworth&rsquo;s
<i>Excursion</i> (all this was Greek to Kim). French, too was vital, and the
best was to be picked up in Chandernagore a few miles from Calcutta. Also a man
might go far, as he himself had done, by strict attention to plays called
<i>Lear</i> and <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, both much in demand by examiners.
<i>Lear</i> was not so full of historical allusions as <i>Julius Cæsar;</i> the
book cost four annas, but could be bought second-hand in Bow Bazar for two.
Still more important than Wordsworth, or the eminent authors, Burke and Hare,
was the art and science of mensuration. A boy who had passed his examination in
these branches&mdash;for which, by the way, there were no
cram-books&mdash;could, by merely marching over a country with a compass and a
level and a straight eye, carry away a picture of that country which might be
sold for large sums in coined silver. But as it was occasionally inexpedient to
carry about measuring-chains a boy would do well to know the precise length of
his own foot-pace, so that when he was deprived of what Hurree Chunder called
adventitious aids he might still tread his distances. To keep count of
thousands of paces, Hurree Chunder&rsquo;s experience had shown him nothing
more valuable than a rosary of eighty-one or a hundred and eight beads, for
&ldquo;it was divisible and sub-divisible into many multiples and
sub-multiples&rdquo;. Through the volleying drifts of English, Kim caught the
general trend of the talk, and it interested him very much. Here was a new
craft that a man could tuck away in his head and by the look of the large wide
world unfolding itself before him, it seemed that the more a man knew the
better for him.
</p>

<p>
Said the Babu when he had talked for an hour and a half &ldquo;I hope some day
to enjoy your offeecial acquaintance. <i>Ad interim</i>, if I may be pardoned
that expression, I shall give you this betel-box, which is highly valuable
article and cost me two rupees only four years ago.&rdquo; It was a cheap,
heart-shaped brass thing with three compartments for carrying the eternal
betel-nut, lime and <i>pan</i>-leaf; but it was filled with little
tabloid-bottles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is reward of merit for your performance in character of that holy
man. You see, you are so young you think you will last for ever and not take
care of your body. It is great nuisance to go sick in the middle of business. I
am fond of drugs myself, and they are handy to cure poor people too. These are
good Departmental drugs&mdash;quinine and so on. I give it you for souvenir.
Now good-bye. I have urgent private business here by the roadside.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He slipped out noiselessly as a cat, on the Umballa road, hailed a passing cart
and jingled away, while Kim, tongue-tied, twiddled the brass betel-box in his
hands.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The record of a boy&rsquo;s education interests few save his parents, and, as
you know, Kim was an orphan. It is written in the books of St Xavier&rsquo;s in
Partibus that a report of Kim&rsquo;s progress was forwarded at the end of each
term to Colonel Creighton and to Father Victor, from whose hands duly came the
money for his schooling. It is further recorded in the same books that he
showed a great aptitude for mathematical studies as well as map-making, and
carried away a prize (<i>The Life of Lord Lawrence</i>, tree-calf, two vols.,
nine rupees, eight annas) for proficiency therein; and the same term played in
St Xavier&rsquo;s eleven against the Alighur Mohammedan College, his age being
fourteen years and ten months. He was also re-vaccinated (from which we may
assume that there had been another epidemic of smallpox at Lucknow) about the
same time. Pencil notes on the edge of an old muster-roll record that he was
punished several times for &ldquo;conversing with improper persons&rdquo;, and
it seems that he was once sentenced to heavy pains for &ldquo;absenting himself
for a day in the company of a street beggar&rdquo;. That was when he got over
the gate and pleaded with the lama through a whole day down the banks of the
Gumti to accompany him on the Road next holidays&mdash;for one month&mdash;for
a little week; and the lama set his face as a flint against it, averring that
the time had not yet come. Kim&rsquo;s business, said the old man as they ate
cakes together, was to get all the wisdom of the Sahibs and then he would see.
The Hand of Friendship must in some way have averted the Whip of Calamity, for
six weeks later Kim seems to have passed an examination in elementary surveying
&ldquo;with great credit&rdquo;, his age being fifteen years and eight months.
From this date the record is silent. His name does not appear in the
year&rsquo;s batch of those who entered for the subordinate Survey of India,
but against it stand the words &ldquo;removed on appointment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Several times in those three years, cast up at the Temple of the Tirthankars in
Benares the lama, a little thinner and a shade yellower, if that were possible,
but gentle and untainted as ever. Sometimes it was from the South that he
came&mdash;from south of Tuticorin, whence the wonderful fire-boats go to
Ceylon where are priests who know Pali; sometimes it was from the wet green
West and the thousand cotton-factory chimneys that ring Bombay; and once from
the North, where he had doubled back eight hundred miles to talk for a day with
the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House. He would stride to his cell in
the cool, cut marble&mdash;the priests of the Temple were good to the old
man,&mdash;wash off the dust of travel, make prayer, and depart for Lucknow,
well accustomed now to the way of the rail, in a third-class carriage.
Returning, it was noticeable, as his friend the Seeker pointed out to the
head-priest, that he ceased for a while to mourn the loss of his River, or to
draw wondrous pictures of the Wheel of Life, but preferred to talk of the
beauty and wisdom of a certain mysterious <i>chela</i> whom no man of the
Temple had ever seen. Yes, he had followed the traces of the Blessed Feet
throughout all India. (The Curator has still in his possession a most
marvellous account of his wanderings and meditations.) There remained nothing
more in life but to find the River of the Arrow. Yet it was shown to him in
dreams that it was a matter not to be undertaken with any hope of success
unless that seeker had with him the one <i>chela</i> appointed to bring the
event to a happy issue, and versed in great wisdom&mdash;such wisdom as
white-haired Keepers of Images possess. For example (here came out the
snuff-gourd, and the kindly Jain priests made haste to be silent):
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Long and long ago, when Devadatta was King of Benares&mdash;let all
listen to the <i>Jâtaka!</i>&mdash;an elephant was captured for a time by the
king&rsquo;s hunters and ere he broke free, beringed with a grievous legiron.
This he strove to remove with hate and frenzy in his heart, and hurrying up and
down the forests, besought his brother-elephants to wrench it asunder. One by
one, with their strong trunks, they tried and failed. At the last they gave it
as their opinion that the ring was not to be broken by any bestial power. And
in a thicket, new-born, wet with moisture of birth, lay a day-old calf of the
herd whose mother had died. The fettered elephant, forgetting his own agony,
said: &lsquo;If I do not help this suckling it will perish under our
feet.&rsquo; So he stood above the young thing, making his legs buttresses
against the uneasily moving herd; and he begged milk of a virtuous cow, and the
calf throve, and the ringed elephant was the calf&rsquo;s guide and defence.
Now the days of an elephant&mdash;let all listen to the
<i>Jâtaka!</i>&mdash;are thirty-five years to his full strength, and through
thirty-five Rains the ringed elephant befriended the younger, and all the while
the fetter ate into the flesh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then one day the young elephant saw the half-buried iron, and turning to
the elder said: &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; &lsquo;It is even my sorrow,&rsquo;
said he who had befriended him. Then that other put out his trunk and in the
twinkling of an eyelash abolished the ring, saying: &lsquo;The appointed time
has come.&rsquo; So the virtuous elephant who had waited temperately and done
kind acts was relieved, at the appointed time, by the very calf whom he had
turned aside to cherish&mdash;let all listen to the <i>Jâtaka!</i> for the
Elephant was Ananda, and the Calf that broke the ring was none other than The
Lord Himself...&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he would shake his head benignly, and over the ever-clicking rosary point
out how free that elephant-calf was from the sin of pride. He was as humble as
a <i>chela</i> who, seeing his master sitting in the dust outside the Gates of
Learning, over-leapt the gates (though they were locked) and took his master to
his heart in the presence of the proud-stomached city. Rich would be the reward
of such a master and such a <i>chela</i> when the time came for them to seek
freedom together!
</p>

<p>
So did the lama speak, coming and going across India as softly as a bat. A
sharp-tongued old woman in a house among the fruit-trees behind Saharunpore
honoured him as the woman honoured the prophet, but his chamber was by no means
upon the wall. In an apartment of the forecourt overlooked by cooing doves he
would sit, while she laid aside her useless veil and chattered of spirits and
fiends of Kulu, of grandchildren unborn, and of the free-tongued brat who had
talked to her in the resting-place. Once, too, he strayed alone from the Grand
Trunk Road below Umballa to the very village whose priest had tried to drug
him; but the kind Heaven that guards lamas sent him at twilight through the
crops, absorbed and unsuspicious, to the Rissaldar&rsquo;s door. Here was like
to have been a grave misunderstanding, for the old soldier asked him why the
Friend of the Stars had gone that way only six days before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That may not be,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;He has gone back to his
own people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He sat in that corner telling a hundred merry tales five nights
ago,&rdquo; his host insisted. &ldquo;True, he vanished somewhat suddenly in
the dawn after foolish talk with my granddaughter. He grows apace, but he is
the same Friend of the Stars as brought me true word of the war. Have ye
parted?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and no,&rdquo; the lama replied. &ldquo;We&mdash;we have not
altogether parted, but the time is not ripe that we should take the Road
together. He acquires wisdom in another place. We must wait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All one&mdash;but if it were not the boy how did he come to speak so
continually of thee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what said he?&rdquo; asked the lama eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sweet words&mdash;an hundred thousand&mdash;that thou art his father and
mother and such all. Pity that he does not take the Qpeen&rsquo;s service. He
is fearless.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This news amazed the lama, who did not then know how religiously Kim kept to
the contract made with Mahbub Ali, and perforce ratified by Colonel
Creighton...
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no holding the young pony from the game,&rdquo; said the
horse-dealer when the Colonel pointed out that vagabonding over India in
holiday time was absurd. &ldquo;If permission be refused to go and come as he
chooses, he will make light of the refusal. Then who is to catch him? Colonel
Sahib, only once in a thousand years is a horse born so well fitted for the
game as this our colt. And we need men.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="poem">
Your tiercel&rsquo;s too long at hack, Sire. He&rsquo;s no eyass<br />
But a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him,<br />
Dangerously free o&rsquo; the air. Faith! were he mine<br />
(As mine&rsquo;s the glove he binds to for his tirings)<br />
I&rsquo;d fly him with a make-hawk. He&rsquo;s in yarak<br />
Plumed to the very point&mdash;so manned, so weathered...<br />
Give him the firmament God made him for,<br />
And what shall take the air of him?&mdash;<i>Old Play.</i>
</p>

<p>
Lurgan Sahib did not use as direct speech, but his advice tallied with
Mahbub&rsquo;s; and the upshot was good for Kim. He knew better now than to
leave Lucknow city in native garb, and if Mahbub were anywhere within reach of
a letter, it was to Mahbub&rsquo;s camp he headed, and made his change under
the Pathan&rsquo;s wary eye. Could the little Survey paint-box that he used for
map-tinting in term-time have found a tongue to tell of holiday doings, he
might have been expelled. Once Mahbub and he went together as far as the
beautiful city of Bombay, with three truckloads of tram-horses, and Mahbub
nearly melted when Kim proposed a sail in a dhow across the Indian Ocean to buy
Gulf Arabs, which, he understood from a hanger-on of the dealer Abdul Rahman,
fetched better prices than mere Kabulis.
</p>

<p>
He dipped his hand into the dish with that great trader when Mahbub and a few
co-religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner. They came back by way of
Karachi by sea, when Kim took his first experience of sea-sickness sitting on
the fore-hatch of a coasting-steamer, well persuaded he had been poisoned. The
Babu&rsquo;s famous drug-box proved useless, though Kim had restocked it at
Bombay. Mahbub had business at Quetta, and there Kim, as Mahbub admitted,
earned his keep, and perhaps a little over, by spending four curious days as
scullion in the house of a fat Commissariat sergeant, from whose office-box, in
an auspicious moment, he removed a little vellum ledger which he copied
out&mdash;it seemed to deal entirely with cattle and camel sales&mdash;by
moonlight, lying behind an outhouse, all through one hot night. Then he
returned the ledger to its place, and, at Mahbub&rsquo;s word, left that
service unpaid, rejoining him six miles down the road, the clean copy in his
bosom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That soldier is a small fish,&rdquo; Mahbub Ali explained, &ldquo;but in
time we shall catch the larger one. He only sells oxen at two prices&mdash;one
for himself and one for the Government&mdash;which I do not think is a
sin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why could not I take away the little book and be done with it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then he would have been frightened, and he would have told his master.
Then we should miss, perhaps, a great number of new rifles which seek their way
up from Quetta to the North. The Game is so large that one sees but a little at
a time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said Kim, and held his tongue. That was in the monsoon
holidays, after he had taken the prize for mathematics. The Christmas holidays
he spent&mdash;deducting ten days for private amusements&mdash;with Lurgan
Sahib, where he sat for the most part in front of a roaring
wood-fire&mdash;Jakko road was four feet deep in snow that
year&mdash;and&mdash;the small Hindu had gone away to be married&mdash;helped
Lurgan to thread pearls. He made Kim learn whole chapters of the Koran by
heart, till he could deliver them with the very roll and cadence of a mullah.
Moreover, he told Kim the names and properties of many native drugs, as well as
the runes proper to recite when you administer them. And in the evenings he
wrote charms on parchment&mdash;elaborate pentagrams crowned with the names of
devils&mdash;Murra, and Awan the Companion of Kings&mdash;all fantastically
written in the corners. More to the point, he advised Kim as to the care of his
own body, the cure of fever-fits, and simple remedies of the Road. A week
before it was time to go down, Colonel Creighton Sahib&mdash;this was
unfair&mdash;sent Kim a written examination paper that concerned itself solely
with rods and chains and links and angles.
</p>

<p>
Next holidays he was out with Mahbub, and here, by the way, he nearly died of
thirst, plodding through the sand on a camel to the mysterious city of Bikanir,
where the wells are four hundred feet deep, and lined throughout with
camel-bone. It was not an amusing trip from Kim&rsquo;s point of view,
because&mdash;in defiance of the contract&mdash;the Colonel ordered him to make
a map of that wild, walled city; and since Mohammedan horse-boys and
pipe-tenders are not expected to drag Survey-chains round the capital of an
independent Native State, Kim was forced to pace all his distances by means of
a bead rosary. He used the compass for bearings as occasion served&mdash;after
dark chiefly, when the camels had been fed&mdash;and by the help of his little
Survey paint-box of six colour-cakes and three brushes, he achieved something
not remotely unlike the city of Jeysulmir. Mahbub laughed a great deal, and
advised him to make up a written report as well; and in the back of the big
account-book that lay under the flap of Mahbub&rsquo;s pet saddle Kim fell to
work..
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must hold everything that thou hast seen or touched or considered.
Write as though the Jung-i-Lat Sahib himself had come by stealth with a vast
army outsetting to war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How great an army?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, half a lakh of men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Folly! Remember how few and bad were the wells in the sand. Not a
thousand thirsty men could come near by here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then write that down&mdash;also all the old breaches in the walls and
whence the firewood is cut&mdash;and what is the temper and disposition of the
King. I stay here till all my horses are sold. I will hire a room by the
gateway, and thou shalt be my accountant. There is a good lock to the
door.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The report in its unmistakable St Xavier&rsquo;s running script, and the brown,
yellow, and lake-daubed map, was on hand a few years ago (a careless clerk
filed it with the rough notes of E&rsquo;s second Seistan survey), but by now
the pencil characters must be almost illegible. Kim translated it, sweating
under the light of an oil-lamp, to Mahbub, the second day of their
return-journey.
</p>

<p>
The Pathan rose and stooped over his dappled saddle-bags.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew it would be worthy a dress of honour, and so I made one
ready,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;Were I Amir of Afghanistan (and some day
we may see him), I would fill thy mouth with gold.&rdquo; He laid the garments
formally at Kim&rsquo;s feet. There was a gold-embroidered Peshawur turban-cap,
rising to a cone, and a big turban-cloth ending in a broad fringe of gold.
There was a Delhi embroidered waistcoat to slip over a milky white shirt,
fastening to the right, ample and flowing; green pyjamas with twisted silk
waist-string; and that nothing might be lacking, russia-leather slippers,
smelling divinely, with arrogantly curled tips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon a Wednesday, and in the morning, to put on new clothes is
auspicious,&rdquo; said Mahbub solemnly. &ldquo;But we must not forget the
wicked folk in the world. So!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He capped all the splendour, that was taking Kim&rsquo;s delighted breath away,
with a mother-of-pearl, nickel-plated, self-extracting .450 revolver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had thought of a smaller bore, but reflected that this takes
Government bullets. A man can always come by those&mdash;especially across the
Border. Stand up and let me look.&rdquo; He clapped Kim on the shoulder.
&ldquo;May you never be tired, Pathan! Oh, the hearts to be broken! Oh, the
eyes under the eyelashes, looking sideways!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim turned about, pointed his toes, stretched, and felt mechanically for the
moustache that was just beginning. Then he stooped towards Mahbub&rsquo;s feet
to make proper acknowledgment with fluttering, quick-patting hands; his heart
too full for words. Mahbub forestalled and embraced him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My son, said he, &ldquo;what need of words between us? But is not the
little gun a delight? All six cartridges come out at one twist. It is borne in
the bosom next the skin, which, as it were, keeps it oiled. Never put it
elsewhere, and please God, thou shalt some day kill a man with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Hai mai!</i>&rdquo; said Kim ruefully. &ldquo;If a Sahib kills a man
he is hanged in the jail.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True: but one pace beyond the Border, men are wiser. Put it away; but
fill it first. Of what use is a gun unfed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I go back to the <i>madrissah</i> I must return it. They do not
allow little guns. Thou wilt keep it for me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Son, I am wearied of that <i>madrissah</i>, where they take the best
years of a man to teach him what he can only learn upon the Road. The folly of
the Sahibs has neither top nor bottom. No matter. Maybe thy written report
shall save thee further bondage; and God He knows we need men more and more in
the Game.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They marched, jaw-bound against blowing sand, across the salt desert to
Jodhpur, where Mahbub and his handsome nephew Habib Ullah did much trading; and
then sorrowfully, in European clothes, which he was fast outgrowing, Kim went
second-class to St Xavier&rsquo;s. Three weeks later, Colonel Creighton,
pricing Tibetan ghost-daggers at Lurgan&rsquo;s shop, faced Mahbub Ali openly
mutinous. Lurgan Sahib operated as support in reserve.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The pony is made&mdash;finished&mdash;mouthed and paced, Sahib! From now
on, day by day, he will lose his manners if he is kept at tricks. Drop the rein
on his back and let go,&rdquo; said the horse-dealer. &ldquo;We need
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he is so young, Mahbub&mdash;not more than sixteen&mdash;is
he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I was fifteen, I had shot my man and begot my man, Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You impenitent old heathen!&rdquo; Creighton turned to Lurgan. The black
beard nodded assent to the wisdom of the Afghan&rsquo;s dyed scarlet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> should have used him long ago,&rdquo; said Lurgan. &ldquo;The
younger the better. That is why I always have my really valuable jewels watched
by a child. You sent him to me to try. I tried him in every way: he is the only
boy I could not make to see things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the crystal&mdash;in the ink-pool?&rdquo; demanded Mahbub.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. Under my hand, as I told you. That has never happened before. It
means that he is strong enough&mdash;but you think it skittles, Colonel
Creighton&mdash;to make anyone do anything he wants. And that is three years
ago. I have taught him a good deal since, Colonel Creighton. I think you waste
him now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hmm! Maybe you&rsquo;re right. But, as you know, there is no Survey work
for him at present.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him out let him go,&rdquo; Mahbub interrupted. &ldquo;Who expects
any colt to carry heavy weight at first? Let him run with the
caravans&mdash;like our white camel-colts&mdash;for luck. I would take him
myself, but&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is a little business where he would be most useful&mdash;in the
South,&rdquo; said Lurgan, with peculiar suavity, dropping his heavy blued
eyelids.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;E.23 has that in hand,&rdquo; said Creighton quickly. &ldquo;He must not
go down there. Besides, he knows no Turki.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only tell him the shape and the smell of the letters we want and he will
bring them back,&rdquo; Lurgan insisted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. That is a man&rsquo;s job,&rdquo; said Creighton.
</p>

<p>
It was a wry-necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary correspondence
between a person who claimed to be the ultimate authority in all matters of the
Mohammedan religion throughout the world, and a younger member of a royal house
who had been brought to book for kidnapping women within British territory. The
Moslem Archbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant; the young prince was
merely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges, but there was no need he
should continue a correspondence which might some day compromise him. One
letter indeed had been procured, but the finder was later found dead by the
roadside in the habit of an Arab trader, as E.23, taking up the work, duly
reported.
</p>

<p>
These facts, and a few others not to be published, made both Mahbub and
Creighton shake their heads.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him go out with his Red Lama,&rdquo; said the horse-dealer with
visible effort. &ldquo;He is fond of the old man. He can learn his paces by the
rosary at least.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have had some dealings with the old man&mdash;by letter,&rdquo; said
Colonel Creighton, smiling to himself. &ldquo;Whither goes he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Up and down the land, as he has these three years. He seeks a River of
Healing. God&rsquo;s curse upon all&mdash;&rdquo; Mahbub checked himself.
&ldquo;He beds down at the Temple of the Tirthankars or at Buddh Gaya when he
is in from the Road. Then he goes to see the boy at the <i>madrissah</i>, as we
know for the boy was punished for it twice or thrice. He is quite mad, but a
peaceful man. I have met him. The Babu also has had dealings with him. We have
watched him for three years. Red Lamas are not so common in Hind that one loses
track.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Babus are very curious,&rdquo; said Lurgan meditatively. &ldquo;Do you
know what Hurree Babu really wants? He wants to be made a member of the Royal
Society by taking ethnological notes. I tell you, I tell him about the lama
everything which Mahbub and the boy have told me. Hurree Babu goes down to
Benares&mdash;at his own expense, I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Creighton briefly. He had paid
Hurree&rsquo;s travelling expenses, out of a most lively curiosity to learn
what the lama might be.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he applies to the lama for information on lamaism, and devil-dances,
and spells and charms, several times in these few years. Holy Virgin! I could
have told him all that yeears ago. I think Hurree Babu is getting too old for
the Road. He likes better to collect manners and customs information. Yes, he
wants to be an FRS.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hurree thinks well of the boy, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very indeed&mdash;we have had some pleasant evenings at my little
place&mdash;but I think it would be waste to throw him away with Hurree on the
Ethnological side.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not for a first experience. How does that strike you, Mahbub? Let the
boy run with the lama for six months. After that we can see. He will get
experience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has it already, Sahib&mdash;as a fish controls the water he swims in.
But for every reason it will be well to loose him from the school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, then,&rdquo; said Creighton, half to himself. &ldquo;He can
go with the lama, and if Hurree Babu cares to keep an eye on them so much the
better. He won&rsquo;t lead the boy into any danger as Mahbub would.
Curious&mdash;his wish to be an F R S. Very human, too. He <i>is</i> best on
the Ethnological side&mdash;Hurree.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No money and no preferment would have drawn Creighton from his work on the
Indian Survey, but deep in his heart also lay the ambition to write &ldquo;F R
S&rdquo; after his name. Honours of a sort he knew could be obtained by
ingenuity and the help of friends, but, to the best of his belief, nothing save
work&mdash;papers representing a life of it&mdash;took a man into the Society
which he had bombarded for years with monographs on strange Asiatic cults and
unknown customs. Nine men out of ten would flee from a Royal Society soiree in
extremity of boredom; but Creighton was the tenth, and at times his soul
yearned for the crowded rooms in easy London where silver-haired, bald-headed
gentlemen who know nothing of the Army move among spectroscopic experiments,
the lesser plants of the frozen tundras, electric flight-measuring machines,
and apparatus for slicing into fractional millimetres the left eye of the
female mosquito. By all right and reason, it was the Royal Geographical that
should have appealed to him, but men are as chancy as children in their choice
of playthings. So Creighton smiled, and thought the better of Hurree Babu,
moved by like desire.
</p>

<p>
He dropped the ghost-dagger and looked up at Mahbub.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How soon can we get the colt from the stable?&rdquo; said the
horse-dealer, reading his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hmm! If I withdraw him by order now&mdash;what will he do, think you? I
have never before assisted at the teaching of such an one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He will come to me,&rdquo; said Mahbub promptly. &ldquo;Lurgan Sahib and
I will prepare him for the Road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So be it, then. For six months he shall run at his choice. But who will
be his sponsor?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lurgan slightly inclined his head. &ldquo;He will not tell anything, if that is
what you are afraid of, Colonel Creighton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a boy, after all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye-es; but first, he has nothing to tell; and secondly, he knows what
would happen. Also, he is very fond of Mahbub, and of me a little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will he draw pay?&rdquo; demanded the practical horse-dealer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Food and water allowance only. Twenty rupees a month.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
One advantage of the Secret Service is that it has no worrying audit. That
Service is ludicrously starved, of course, but the funds are administered by a
few men who do not call for vouchers or present itemized accounts.
Mahbub&rsquo;s eyes lighted with almost a Sikh&rsquo;s love of money. Even
Lurgan&rsquo;s impassive face changed. He considered the years to come when Kim
would have been entered and made to the Great Game that never ceases day and
night, throughout India. He foresaw honour and credit in the mouths of a chosen
few, coming to him from his pupil. Lurgan Sahib had made E.23 what E.23 was,
out of a bewildered, impertinent, lying, little North-West Province man.
</p>

<p>
But the joy of these masters was pale and smoky beside the joy of Kim when St
Xavier&rsquo;s Head called him aside, with word that Colonel Creighton had sent
for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I understand, O&rsquo;Hara, that he has found you a place as an
assistant chain-man in the Canal Department: that comes of taking up
mathematics. It is great luck for you, for you are only sixteen; but of course
you understand that you do not become <i>pukka</i> (permanent) till you have
passed the autumn examination. So you must not think you are going out into the
world to enjoy yourself, or that your fortune is made. There is a great deal of
hard work before you. Only, if you succeed in becoming <i>pukka</i>, you can
rise, you know, to four hundred and fifty a month.&rdquo; Whereat the Principal
gave him much good advice as to his conduct, and his manners, and his morals;
and others, his elders, who had not been wafted into billets, talked as only
Anglo-Indian lads can, of favouritism and corruption. Indeed, young Cazalet,
whose father was a pensioner at Chunar, hinted very broadly that Colonel
Creighton&rsquo;s interest in Kim was directly paternal; and Kim, instead of
retaliating, did not even use language. He was thinking of the immense fun to
come, of Mahbub&rsquo;s letter of the day before, all neatly written in
English, making appointment for that afternoon in a house the very name of
which would have crisped the Principal&rsquo;s hair with horror...
</p>

<p>
Said Kim to Mahbub in Lucknow railway station that evening, above the
luggage-scales: &ldquo;I feared lest at the last, the roof would fall upon me
and cheat me. It is indeed all finished, O my father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mahbub snapped his fingers to show the utterness of that end, and his eyes
blazed like red coals.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then where is the pistol that I may wear it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Softly! A half-year, to run without heel-ropes. I begged that much from
Colonel Creighton Sahib. At twenty rupees a month. Old Red Hat knows that thou
art coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will pay thee <i>dustoorie</i> (commission) on my pay for three
months,&rdquo; said Kim gravely. &ldquo;Yea, two rupees a month. But first we
must get rid of these.&rdquo; He plucked his thin linen trousers and dragged at
his collar. &ldquo;I have brought with me all that I need on the Road. My trunk
has gone up to Lurgan Sahib&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who sends his salaams to thee&mdash;Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lurgan Sahib is a very clever man. But what dost thou do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I go North again, upon the Great Game. What else? Is thy mind still set
on following old Red Hat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not forget he made me that I am&mdash;though he did not know it. Year
by year, he sent the money that taught me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would have done as much&mdash;had it struck my thick head,&rdquo;
Mahbub growled. &ldquo;Come away. The lamps are lit now, and none will mark
thee in the bazar. We go to Huneefa&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the way thither, Mahbub gave him much the same sort of advice as his mother
gave to Lemuel, and curiously enough, Mahbub was exact to point out how Huneefa
and her likes destroyed kings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I remember,&rdquo; he quoted maliciously, &ldquo;one who said,
&lsquo;Trust a snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub
Ali.&rsquo; Now, excepting as to Pathans, of whom I am one, all that is true.
Most true is it in the Great Game, for it is by means of women that all plans
come to ruin and we lie out in the dawning with our throats cut. So it happened
to such a one.&rdquo; He gave the reddest particulars.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why&mdash;?&rdquo; Kim paused before a filthy staircase that
climbed to the warm darkness of an upper chamber, in the ward that is behind
Azim Ullah&rsquo;s tobacco-shop. Those who know it call it The
Birdcage&mdash;it is so full of whisperings and whistlings and chirrupings.
</p>

<p>
The room, with its dirty cushions and half-smoked hookahs, smelt abominably of
stale tobacco. In one corner lay a huge and shapeless woman clad in greenish
gauzes, and decked, brow, nose, ear, neck, wrist, arm, waist, and ankle with
heavy native jewellery. When she turned it was like the clashing of copper
pots. A lean cat in the balcony outside the window mewed hungrily. Kim checked,
bewildered, at the door-curtain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that the new stuff, Mahbub?&rdquo; said Huneefa lazily, scarce
troubling to remove the mouthpiece from her lips. &ldquo;O
Buktanoos!&rdquo;&mdash;like most of her kind, she swore by the
Djinns&mdash;&ldquo;O Buktanoos! He is very good to look upon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is part of the selling of the horse,&rdquo; Mahbub explained to
Kim, who laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have heard that talk since my Sixth Day,&rdquo; he replied, squatting
by the light. &ldquo;Whither does it lead?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To protection. Tonight we change thy colour. This sleeping under roofs
has blanched thee like an almond. But Huneefa has the secret of a colour that
catches. No painting of a day or two. Also, we fortify thee against the chances
of the Road. That is <i>my</i> gift to thee, my son. Take out all metals on
thee and lay them here. Make ready, Huneefa.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim dragged forth his compass, Survey paint-box, and the new-filled
medicine-box. They had all accompanied his travels, and boylike he valued them
immensely.
</p>

<p>
The woman rose slowly and moved with her hands a little spread before her. Then
Kim saw that she was blind. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;the
Pathan speaks truth&mdash;my colour does not go in a week or a month, and those
whom I protect are under strong guard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When one is far off and alone, it would not be well to grow blotched and
leprous of a sudden,&rdquo; said Mahbub. &ldquo;When thou wast with me I could
oversee the matter. Besides, a Pathan is a fair-skin. Strip to the waist now
and look how thou art whitened.&rdquo; Huneefa felt her way back from an inner
room. &ldquo;It is no matter, she cannot see.&rdquo; He took a pewter bowl from
her ringed hand.
</p>

<p>
The dye-stuff showed blue and gummy. Kim experimented on the back of his wrist,
with a dab of cotton-wool; but Huneefa heard him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the thing is not done thus, but with
the proper ceremonies. The colouring is the least part. I give thee the full
protection of the Road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Jadoo?</i> (magic),&rdquo;said Kim, with a half start. He did not
like the white, sightless eyes. Mahbub&rsquo;s hand on his neck bowed him to
the floor, nose within an inch of the boards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be still. No harm comes to thee, my son. I am thy sacrifice!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He could not see what the woman was about, but heard the dish-clash of her
jewellery for many minutes. A match lit up the darkness; he caught the
well-known purr and fizzle of grains of incense. Then the room filled with
smoke&mdash;heavy aromatic, and stupefying. Through growing drowse he heard the
names of devils&mdash;of Zulbazan, Son of Eblis, who lives in bazars and
<i>paraos</i>, making all the sudden lewd wickedness of wayside halts; of
Dulhan, invisible about mosques, the dweller among the slippers of the
faithful, who hinders folk from their prayers; and Musboot, Lord of lies and
panic. Huneefa, now whispering in his ear, now talking as from an immense
distance, touched him with horrible soft fingers, but Mahbub&rsquo;s grip never
shifted from his neck till, relaxing with a sigh, the boy lost his senses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah! How he fought! We should never have done it but for the drugs.
That was his white blood, I take it,&rdquo; said Mahbub testily. &ldquo;Go on
with the <i>dawut</i> (invocation). Give him full Protection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>O Hearer! Thou that hearest with ears, be present. Listen, O
Hearer!</i>&rdquo; Huneefa moaned, her dead eyes turned to the west. The dark
room filled with moanings and snortings.
</p>

<p>
From the outer balcony, a ponderous figure raised a round bullet head and
coughed nervously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not interrupt this ventriloquial necromanciss, my friend,&rdquo; it
said in English. &ldquo;I opine that it is very disturbing to you, but no
enlightened observer is jolly-well upset.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;...<i>I will lay a plot for their ruin! O Prophet, bear with the
unbelievers. Let them alone awhile!</i>&rdquo; Huneefa&rsquo;s face, turned to
the northward, worked horribly, and it was as though voices from the ceiling
answered her.
</p>

<p>
Hurree Babu returned to his note-book, balanced on the window-sill, but his
hand shook. Huneefa, in some sort of drugged ecstasy, wrenched herself to and
fro as she sat cross-legged by Kim&rsquo;s still head, and called upon devil
after devil, in the ancient order of the ritual, binding them to avoid the
boy&rsquo;s every action.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>With Him are the keys of the Secret Things! None knoweth them besides
Himself He knoweth that which is in the dry land and in the sea!</i>&rdquo;
Again broke out the unearthly whistling responses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I apprehend it is not at all malignant in its operation?&rdquo;
said the Babu, watching the throat-muscles quiver and jerk as Huneefa spoke
with tongues. &ldquo;It&mdash;it is not likely that she has killed the boy? If
so, I decline to be witness at the trial .....What was the last hypothetical
devil mentioned?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Babuji,&rdquo; said Mahbub in the vernacular. &ldquo;I have no regard
for the devils of Hind, but the Sons of Eblis are far otherwise, and whether
they be <i>jumalee</i> (well-affected) or <i>jullalee</i> (terrible) they love
not Kafirs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you think I had better go?&rdquo; said Hurree Babu, half rising.
&ldquo;They are, of course, dematerialized phenomena. Spencer says.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Huneefa&rsquo;s crisis passed, as these things must, in a paroxysm of howling,
with a touch of froth at the lips. She lay spent and motionless beside Kim, and
the crazy voices ceased.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wah! That work is done. May the boy be better for it; and Huneefa is
surely a mistress of <i>dawut</i>. Help haul her aside, Babu. Do not be
afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How am I to fear the absolutely non-existent?&rdquo; said Hurree Babu,
talking English to reassure himself. It is an awful thing still to dread the
magic that you contemptuously investigate&mdash;to collect folk-lore for the
Royal Society with a lively belief in all Powers of Darkness.
</p>

<p>
Mahbub chuckled. He had been out with Hurree on the Road ere now. &ldquo;Let us
finish the colouring,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The boy is well protected
if&mdash;if the Lords of the Air have ears to hear. I am a <i>sufi</i>
(free-thinker), but when one can get blind-sides of a woman, a stallion, or a
devil, why go round to invite a kick? Set him upon the way, Babu, and see that
old Red Hat does not lead him beyond our reach. I must get back to my
horses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All raight,&rdquo; said Hurree Babu. &ldquo;He is at present curious
spectacle.&rdquo;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
About third cockcrow, Kim woke after a sleep of thousands of years. Huneefa, in
her corner, snored heavily, but Mahbub was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you were not frightened,&rdquo; said an oily voice at his elbow.
&ldquo;I superintended entire operation, which was most interesting from
ethnological point of view. It was high-class <i>dawut</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Kim, recognizing Hurree Babu, who smiled
ingratiatingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And also I had honour to bring down from Lurgan your present costume. I
am not in the habit offeecially of carrying such gauds to subordinates,
but&rdquo;&mdash;he giggled&mdash;&ldquo;your case is noted as exceptional on
the books. I hope Mr Lurgan will note my action.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim yawned and stretched himself. It was good to turn and twist within loose
clothes once again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; He looked curiously at the heavy duffle-stuff
loaded with the scents of the far North.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho! That is inconspicuous dress of <i>chela</i> attached to service of
lamaistic lama. <i>Com</i>plete in every particular,&rdquo; said Hurree Babu,
rolling into the balcony to clean his teeth at a goglet. &ldquo;I am of
opeenion it is not your old gentleman&rsquo;s precise releegion, but rather
sub-variant of same. I have contributed rejected notes To Whom It May Concern:
<i>Asiatic Quarterly Review</i> on these subjects. Now it is curious that the
old gentleman himself is totally devoid of releegiosity. He is not a dam&rsquo;
particular.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hurree Babu held up his hand to show he was engaged in the prescribed rites
that accompany tooth-cleaning and such things among decently bred Bengalis.
Then he recited in English an Arya-Somaj prayer of a theistical nature, and
stuffed his mouth with <i>pan</i> and betel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah yes. I have met him several times at Benares, and also at Buddh
Gaya, to interrogate him on releegious points and devil-worship. He is pure
agnostic&mdash;same as me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Huneefa stirred in her sleep, and Hurree Babu jumped nervously to the copper
incense-burner, all black and discoloured in morning-light, rubbed a finger in
the accumulated lamp-black, and drew it diagonally across his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who has died in thy house?&rdquo; asked Kim in the vernacular.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None. But she may have the Evil Eye&mdash;that sorceress,&rdquo; the
Babu replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What dost thou do now, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will set thee on thy way to Benares, if thou goest thither, and tell
thee what must be known by Us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I go. At what hour runs the <i>te-rain?</i>&rdquo; He rose to his feet,
looked round the desolate chamber and at the yellow-wax face of Huneefa as the
low sun stole across the floor. &ldquo;Is there money to be paid that
witch?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. She has charmed thee against all devils and all dangers in the name
of her devils. It was Mahbub&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo; In English: &ldquo;He is
highly obsolete, <i>I</i> think, to indulge in such supersteetion. Why, it is
all ventri<i>lo</i>quy. Belly-speak&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim snapped his fingers mechanically to avert whatever evil&mdash;Mahbub, he
knew, meditated none&mdash;might have crept in through Huneefa&rsquo;s
ministrations; and Hurree giggled once more. But as he crossed the room he was
careful not to step in Huneefa&rsquo;s blotched, squat shadow on the boards.
Witches&mdash;when their time is on them&mdash;can lay hold of the heels of a
man&rsquo;s soul if he does that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you must well listen,&rdquo; said the Babu when they were in the
fresh air. &ldquo;Part of these ceremonies which we witnessed they include
supply of effeecient amulet to those of our Department. If you feel in your
neck you will find one small silver amulet, verree cheap. That is <i>ours</i>.
Do you understand?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah yes, <i>hawa-dilli</i> (a heart-lifter),&rdquo; said Kim, feeling at
his neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Huneefa she makes them for two rupees twelve annas with&mdash;oh, all
sorts of exorcisms. They are quite common, except they are partially black
enamel, and there is a paper inside each one full of names of local saints and
such things. <i>Thatt</i> is Huneefa&rsquo;s look-out, you see? Huneefa makes
them onlee for us, but in case she does not, when we get them we put in, before
issue, one small piece of turquoise. Mr Lurgan he gives them. There is no other
source of supply; but it was me invented all this. It is strictly unoffeecial
of course, but convenient for subordinates. Colonel Creighton he does not know.
He is European. The turquoise is wrapped in the paper ... Yes, that is road to
railway station ... Now suppose you go with the lama, or with me, I hope, some
day, or with Mahbub. Suppose we get into a dam&rsquo;-tight place. I am a
fearful man&mdash;most fearful&mdash;but I tell you I have been in
dam&rsquo;-tight places more than hairs on my head. You say: &lsquo;I am Son of
the Charm.&rsquo; Verree good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not understand quite. We must not be heard talking English
here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is all raight. I am only Babu showing off my English to you. All we
Babus talk English to show off;&rdquo; said Hurree, flinging his shoulder-cloth
jauntily. &ldquo;As I was about to say, &lsquo;Son of the Charm&rsquo; means
that you may be member of the <i>Sat Bhai</i>&mdash;the Seven Brothers, which
is Hindi <i>and</i> Tantric. It is popularly supposed to be extinct Society,
but I have written notes to show it is still extant. You see, it is all my
invention. Verree good. <i>Sat Bhai</i> has many members, and perhaps before
they jolly-well-cut-your-throat they may give you just a chance of life. That
is useful, anyhow. And moreover, these foolish natives&mdash;if they are not
too excited&mdash;they always stop to think before they kill a man who says he
belongs to any speecific organization. You see? You say then when you are in
tight place, &lsquo;I am Son of the Charm&rsquo;, and you
get&mdash;perhaps&mdash;ah&mdash;your second wind. That is only in extreme
instances, or to open negotiations with a stranger. Can you quite see? Verree
good. But suppose now, I, or any one of the Department, come to you dressed
quite different. You would not know me at all unless I choose, I bet you. Some
day I will prove it. I come as Ladakhi trader&mdash;oh, anything&mdash;and I
say to you: &lsquo;You want to buy precious stones?&rsquo; You say: &lsquo;Do I
look like a man who buys precious stones?&rsquo; Then I say: &lsquo;Even verree
poor man can buy a turquoise or <i>tarkeean</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is <i>kichree</i>&mdash;vegetable curry,&rdquo; said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course it is. You say: &lsquo;Let me see the <i>tarkeean</i>.&rsquo;
Then I say: &lsquo;It was cooked by a woman, and perhaps it is bad for your
caste.&rsquo; Then you say: &lsquo;There is no caste when men go to&mdash;look
for <i>tarkeean</i>.&rsquo; You stop a little between those words,
&lsquo;to&mdash;look&rsquo;. That is thee whole secret. The little stop before
the words.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim repeated the test-sentence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is all right. Then I will show you my turquoise if there is time,
and then you know who I am, and then we exchange views and documents and
those-all things. And so it is with any other man of us. We talk sometimes
about turquoises and sometimes about <i>tarkeean</i>, but always with that
little stop in the words. It is verree easy. First, &lsquo;Son of the
Charm&rsquo;, if you are in a tight place. Perhaps that may help
you&mdash;perhaps not. Then what I have told you about the <i>tarkeean</i>, if
you want to transact offeecial business with a strange man. Of course, at
present, you have no offeecial business. You are&mdash;ah
ha!&mdash;supernumerary on probation. Quite unique specimen. If you were
Asiatic of birth you might be employed right off; but this half-year of leave
is to make you de-Englishized, you see? The lama he expects you, because I have
demi-offeecially informed him you have passed all your examinations, and will
soon obtain Government appointment. Oh ho! You are on acting-allowance, you
see: so if you are called upon to help Sons of the Charm mind you jolly-well
try. Now I shall say good-bye, my dear fellow, and I hope
you&mdash;ah&mdash;will come out top-side all raight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hurree Babu stepped back a pace or two into the crowd at the entrance of
Lucknow station and&mdash;was gone. Kim drew a deep breath and hugged himself
all over. The nickel-plated revolver he could feel in the bosom of his
sad-coloured robe, the amulet was on his neck; begging-gourd, rosary, and
ghost-dagger (Mr Lurgan had forgotten nothing) were all to hand, with medicine,
paint-box, and compass, and in a worn old purse-belt embroidered with
porcupine-quill patterns lay a month&rsquo;s pay. Kings could be no richer. He
bought sweetmeats in a leaf-cup from a Hindu trader, and ate them with glad
rapture till a policeman ordered him off the steps.

</p>

<p>
Followed a sudden natural reaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now am I alone&mdash;all alone,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;In all India
is no one so alone as I! If I die today, who shall bring the news&mdash;and to
whom? If I live and God is good, there will be a price upon my head, for I am a
Son of the Charm&mdash;I, Kim.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A very few white people, but many Asiatics, can throw themselves into a
mazement as it were by repeating their own names over and over again to
themselves, letting the mind go free upon speculation as to what is called
personal identity. When one grows older, the power, usually, departs, but while
it lasts it may descend upon a man at any moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is Kim&mdash;Kim&mdash;Kim?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He squatted in a corner of the clanging waiting-room, rapt from all other
thoughts; hands folded in lap, and pupils contracted to pin-points. In a
minute&mdash;in another half-second&mdash;he felt he would arrive at the
solution of the tremendous puzzle; but here, as always happens, his mind
dropped away from those heights with a rush of a wounded bird, and passing his
hand before his eyes, he shook his head.
</p>

<p>
A long-haired Hindu <i>bairagi</i> (holy man), who had just bought a ticket,
halted before him at that moment and stared intently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I also have lost it,&rdquo; he said sadly. &ldquo;It is one of the Gates
to the Way, but for me it has been shut many years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the talk?&rdquo; said Kim, abashed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou wast wondering there in thy spirit what manner of thing thy soul
might be. The seizure came of a sudden. <i>I</i> know. Who should know but I?
Whither goest thou?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Toward Kashi [Benares].&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are no Gods there. I have proved them. I go to Prayag [Allahabad]
for the fifth time&mdash;seeking the Road to Enlightenment. Of what faith art
thou?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I too am a Seeker,&rdquo; said Kim, using one of the lama&rsquo;s pet
words. &ldquo;Though&rdquo;&mdash;he forgot his Northern dress for the
moment&mdash;&ldquo;though Allah alone knoweth what I seek.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old fellow slipped the <i>bairagi&rsquo;s</i> crutch under his armpit and
sat down on a patch of ruddy leopard&rsquo;s skin as Kim rose at the call for
the Benares train.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go in hope, little brother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is a long road to
the feet of the One; but thither do we all travel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim did not feel so lonely after this, and ere he had sat out twenty miles in
the crowded compartment, was cheering his neighbours with a string of most
wonderful yarns about his own and his master&rsquo;s magical gifts.
</p>

<p>
Benares struck him as a peculiarly filthy city, though it was pleasant to find
how his cloth was respected. At least one-third of the population prays
eternally to some group or other of the many million deities, and so reveres
every sort of holy man. Kim was guided to the Temple of the Tirthankars, about
a mile outside the city, near Sarnath, by a chance-met Punjabi farmer&mdash;a
Kamboh from Jullundur-way who had appealed in vain to every God of his
homestead to cure his small son, and was trying Benares as a last resort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou art from the North?&rdquo; he asked, shouldering through the press
of the narrow, stinking streets much like his own pet bull at home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, I know the Punjab. My mother was a pahareen, but my father came from
Amritzar&mdash;by Jandiala,&rdquo; said Kim, oiling his ready tongue for the
needs of the Road.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jandiala&mdash;Jullundur? Oho! Then we be neighbours in some sort, as it
were.&rdquo; He nodded tenderly to the wailing child in his arms. &ldquo;Whom
dost thou serve?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A most holy man at the Temple of the Tirthankers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are all most holy and&mdash;most greedy,&rdquo; said the Jat with
bitterness. &ldquo;I have walked the pillars and trodden the temples till my
feet are flayed, and the child is no whit better. And the mother being sick too
... Hush, then, little one ... We changed his name when the fever came. We put
him into girl&rsquo;s clothes. There was nothing we did not do, except&mdash;I
said to his mother when she bundled me off to Benares&mdash;she should have
come with me&mdash;I <i>said</i> Sakhi Sarwar Sultan would serve us best. We
know His generosity, but these down-country Gods are strangers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The child turned on the cushion of the huge corded arms and looked at Kim
through heavy eyelids.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And was it all worthless?&rdquo; Kim asked, with easy interest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All worthless&mdash;all worthless,&rdquo; said the child, lips cracking
with fever.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Gods have given him a good mind, at least&rdquo; said the father
proudly. &ldquo;To think he should have listened so cleverly. Yonder is thy
Temple. Now I am a poor man&mdash;many priests have dealt with me&mdash;but my
son is my son, and if a gift to thy master can cure him&mdash;I am at my very
wits&rsquo; end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim considered for a while, tingling with pride. Three years ago he would have
made prompt profit on the situation and gone his way without a thought; but
now, the very respect the Jat paid him proved that he was a man. Moreover, he
had tasted fever once or twice already, and knew enough to recognize starvation
when he saw it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Call him forth and I will give him a bond on my best yoke, so that the
child is cured.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim halted at the carved outer door of the temple. A white-clad Oswal banker
from Ajmir, his sins of usury new wiped out, asked him what he did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am <i>chela</i> to Teshoo Lama, an Holy One from Bhotiyal&mdash;within
there. He bade me come. I wait. Tell him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not forget the child,&rdquo; cried the importunate Jat over his
shoulder, and then bellowed in Punjabi; &ldquo;O Holy One&mdash;O disciple of
the Holy One&mdash;O Gods above all the Worlds&mdash;behold affliction sitting
at the gate!&rdquo; That cry is so common in Benares that the passers never
turned their heads.
</p>

<p>
The Oswal, at peace with mankind, carried the message into the darkness behind
him, and the easy, uncounted Eastern minutes slid by; for the lama was asleep
in his cell, and no priest would wake him. When the click of his rosary again
broke the hush of the inner court where the calm images of the Arhats stand, a
novice whispered, &ldquo;Thy <i>chela</i> is here,&rdquo; and the old man
strode forth, forgetting the end of that prayer.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had the tall figure shown in the doorway than the Jat ran before him,
and, lifting up the child, cried: &ldquo;Look upon this, Holy One; and if the
Gods will, he lives&mdash;he lives!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He fumbled in his waist-belt and drew out a small silver coin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is now?&rdquo; The lama&rsquo;s eyes turned to Kim. It was
noticeable he spoke far clearer Urdu than long ago, under ZamZammah; but father
would allow no private talk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is no more than a fever,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;The child is not
well fed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He sickens at everything, and his mother is not here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it be permitted, I may cure, Holy One.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! Have they made thee a healer? Wait here,&rdquo; said the lama, and
he sat down by the Jat upon the lowest step of the temple, while Kim, looking
out of the corner of his eyes, slowly opened the little betel-box. He had
dreamed dreams at school of returning to the lama as a Sahib&mdash;of chaffing
the old man before he revealed himself&mdash;boy&rsquo;s dreams all. There was
more drama in this abstracted, brow-puckered search through the
tabloid-bottles, with a pause here and there for thought and a muttered
invocation between whiles. Quinine he had in tablets, and dark brown
meat-lozenges&mdash;beef most probably, but that was not <i>his</i> business.
The little thing would not eat, but it sucked at a lozenge greedily, and said
it liked the salt taste.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take then these six.&rdquo; Kim handed them to the man. &ldquo;Praise
the Gods, and boil three in milk; other three in water. After he has drunk the
milk give him this&rdquo; (it was the half of a quinine pill), &ldquo;and wrap
him warm. Give him the water of the other three, and the other half of this
white pill when he wakes. Meantime, here is another brown medicine that he may
suck at on the way home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gods, what wisdom!&rdquo; said the Kamboh, snatching.
</p>

<p>
It was as much as Kim could remember of his own treatment in a bout of autumn
malaria&mdash;if you except the patter that he added to impress the lama.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now go! Come again in the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the price&mdash;the price,&rdquo; said the Jat, and threw back his
sturdy shoulders. &ldquo;My son is my son. Now that he will be whole again, how
shall I go back to his mother and say I took help by the wayside and did not
even give a bowl of curds in return?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are alike, these Jats,&rdquo; said Kim softly. &ldquo;The Jat stood
on his dunghill and the King&rsquo;s elephants went by. &lsquo;O driver,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;what will you sell those little donkeys for?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Jat burst into a roar of laughter, stifled with apologies to the lama.
&ldquo;It is the saying of my own country the very talk of it. So are we Jats
all. I will come tomorrow with the child; and the blessing of the Gods of the
Homesteads&mdash;who are good little Gods&mdash;be on you both ... Now, son, we
grow strong again. Do not spit it out, little Princeling! King of my Heart, do
not spit it out, and we shall be strong men, wrestlers and club-wielders, by
morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He moved away, crooning and mumbling. The lama turned to Kim, and all the
loving old soul of him looked out through his narrow eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To heal the sick is to acquire merit; but first one gets knowledge. That
was wisely done, O Friend of all the World.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was made wise by thee, Holy One,&rdquo; said Kim, forgetting the
little play just ended; forgetting St Xavier&rsquo;s; forgetting his white
blood; forgetting even the Great Game as he stooped, Mohammedan-fashion, to
touch his master&rsquo;s feet in the dust of the Jain temple. &ldquo;My
teaching I owe to thee. I have eaten thy bread three years. My time is
finished. I am loosed from the schools. I come to thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Herein is my reward. Enter! Enter! And is all well?&rdquo; They passed
to the inner court, where the afternoon sun sloped golden across. &ldquo;Stand
that I may see. So!&rdquo; He peered critically. &ldquo;It is no longer a
child, but a man, ripened in wisdom, walking as a physician. I did well&mdash;I
did well when I gave thee up to the armed men on that black night. Dost thou
remember our first day under Zam-Zammah?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;Dost thou remember when I leapt off the
carriage the first day I went to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Gates of Learning? Truly. And the day that we ate the cakes together
at the back of the river by Nucklao. Aha! Many times hast thou begged for me,
but that day I begged for thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good reason,&rdquo; quoth Kim. &ldquo;I was then a scholar in the Gates
of Learning, and attired as a Sahib. Do not forget, Holy One,&rdquo; he went on
playfully. &ldquo;I am still a Sahib&mdash;by thy favour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True. And a Sahib in most high esteem. Come to my cell,
<i>chela</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How is that known to thee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama smiled. &ldquo;First by means of letters from the kindly priest whom
we met in the camp of armed men; but he is now gone to his own country, and I
sent the money to his brother.&rdquo; Colonel Creighton, who had succeeded to
the trusteeship when Father Victor went to England with the Mavericks, was
hardly the Chaplain&rsquo;s brother. &ldquo;But I do not well understand
Sahibs&rsquo; letters. They must be interpreted to me. I chose a surer way.
Many times when I returned from my Search to this Temple, which has always been
a nest to me, there came one seeking Enlightenment&mdash;a man from
Leh&mdash;that had been, he said, a Hindu, but wearied of all those
Gods.&rdquo; The lama pointed to the Arhats.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fat man?&rdquo; said Kim, a twinkle in his eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very fat; but I perceived in a little his mind was wholly given up to
useless things&mdash;such as devils and charms and the form and fashion of our
tea-drinkings in the monasteries, and by what road we initiated the novices. A
man abounding in questions; but he was a friend of thine, <i>chela</i>. He told
me that thou wast on the road to much honour as a scribe. And I see thou art a
physician.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that am I&mdash;a scribe, when I am a Sahib, but it is set aside
when I come as thy disciple. I have accomplished the years appointed for a
Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As it were a novice?&rdquo; said the lama, nodding his head. &ldquo;Art
thou freed from the schools? I would not have thee unripe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am all free. In due time I take service under the Government as a
scribe&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not as a warrior. That is well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But first I come to wander with thee. Therefore I am here. Who begs for
thee, these days?&rdquo; he went on quickly. The ice was thin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very often I beg myself; but, as thou knowest, I am seldom here, except
when I come to look again at my disciple. From one end to another of Hind have
I travelled afoot and in the <i>te-rain</i>. A great and a wonderful land! But
here, when I put in, is as though I were in my own Bhotiyal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked round the little clean cell complacently. A low cushion gave him a
seat, on which he had disposed himself in the cross-legged attitude of the
Bodhisat emerging from meditation; a black teak-wood table, not twenty inches
high, set with copper tea-cups, was before him. In one corner stood a tiny
altar, also of heavily carved teak, bearing a copper-gilt image of the seated
Buddha and fronted by a lamp, an incense-holder, and a pair of copper
flower-pots.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House acquired merit by giving me
these a year since,&rdquo; he said, following Kim&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;When one
is far from one&rsquo;s own land such things carry remembrance; and we must
reverence the Lord for that He showed the Way. See!&rdquo; He pointed to a
curiously-built mound of coloured rice crowned with a fantastic metal ornament.
&ldquo;When I was Abbot in my own place&mdash;before I came to better knowledge
I made that offering daily. It is the Sacrifice of the Universe to the Lord.
Thus do we of Bhotiyal offer all the world daily to the Excellent Law. And I do
it even now, though I know that the Excellent One is beyond all pinchings and
pattings.&rdquo; He snuffed from his gourd.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is well done, Holy One,&rdquo; Kim murmured, sinking at ease on the
cushions, very happy and rather tired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And also,&rdquo; the old man chuckled, &ldquo;I write pictures of the
Wheel of Life. Three days to a picture. I was busied on it&mdash;or it may be I
shut my eyes a little&mdash;when they brought word of thee. It is good to have
thee here: I will show thee my art&mdash;not for pride&rsquo;s sake, but
because thou must learn. The Sahibs have not <i>all</i> this world&rsquo;s
wisdom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He drew from under the table a sheet of strangely scented yellow Chinese paper,
the brushes, and slab of Indian ink. In cleanest, severest outline he had
traced the Great Wheel with its six spokes, whose centre is the conjoined Hog,
Snake, and Dove (Ignorance, Anger, and Lust), and whose compartments are all
the Heavens and Hells, and all the chances of human life. Men say that the
Bodhisat Himself first drew it with grains of rice upon dust, to teach His
disciples the cause of things. Many ages have crystallized it into a most
wonderful convention crowded with hundreds of little figures whose every line
carries a meaning. Few can translate the picture-parable; there are not twenty
in all the world who can draw it surely without a copy: of those who can both
draw and expound are but three.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a little learned to draw,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;But this is a
marvel beyond marvels.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have written it for many years,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;Time was
when I could write it all between one lamp-lighting and the next. I will teach
thee the art&mdash;after due preparation; and I will show thee the meaning of
the Wheel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We take the Road, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Road and our Search. I was but waiting for thee. It was made plain
to me in a hundred dreams&mdash;notably one that came upon the night of the day
that the Gates of Learning first shut that without thee I should never find my
River. Again and again, as thou knowest, I put this from me, fearing an
illusion. Therefore I would not take thee with me that day at Lucknow, when we
ate the cakes. I would not take thee till the time was ripe and auspicious.
From the Hills to the Sea, from the Sea to the Hills have I gone, but it was
vain. Then I remembered the <i>Jâtaka</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He told Kim the story of the elephant with the leg-iron, as he had told it so
often to the Jam priests.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Further testimony is not needed,&rdquo; he ended serenely. &ldquo;Thou
wast sent for an aid. That aid removed, my Search came to naught. Therefore we
will go out again together, and our Search sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whither go we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What matters, Friend of all the World? The Search, I say, is sure. If
need be, the River will break from the ground before us. I acquired merit when
I sent thee to the Gates of Learning, and gave thee the jewel that is Wisdom.
Thou didst return, I saw even now, a follower of Sakyamuni, the Physician,
whose altars are many in Bhotiyal. It is sufficient. We are together, and all
things are as they were&mdash;Friend of all the World&mdash;Friend of the
Stars&mdash;my <i>chela!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then they talked of matters secular; but it was noticeable that the lama never
demanded any details of life at St Xavier&rsquo;s, nor showed the faintest
curiosity as to the manners and customs of Sahibs. His mind moved all in the
past, and he revived every step of their wonderful first journey together,
rubbing his hands and chuckling, till it pleased him to curl himself up into
the sudden sleep of old age.
</p>

<p>
Kim watched the last dusty sunshine fade out of the court, and played with his
ghost-dagger and rosary. The clamour of Benares, oldest of all earth&rsquo;s
cities awake before the Gods, day and night, beat round the walls as the
sea&rsquo;s roar round a breakwater. Now and again, a Jain priest crossed the
court, with some small offering to the images, and swept the path about him
lest by chance he should take the life of a living thing. A lamp twinkled, and
there followed the sound of a prayer. Kim watched the stars as they rose one
after another in the still, sticky dark, till he fell asleep at the foot of the
altar. That night he dreamed in Hindustani, with never an English word...
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Holy One, there is the child to whom we gave the medicine,&rdquo; he
said, about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when the lama, also waking from
dreams, would have fared forth on pilgrimage. &ldquo;The Jat will be here at
the light.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am well answered. In my haste I would have done a wrong.&rdquo; He sat
down on the cushions and returned to his rosary. &ldquo;Surely old folk are as
children,&rdquo; he said pathetically. &ldquo;They desire a
matter&mdash;behold, it must be done at once, or they fret and weep! Many times
when I was upon the Road I have been ready to stamp with my feet at the
hindrance of an ox-cart in the way, or a mere cloud of dust. It was not so when
I was a man&mdash;a long time ago. None the less it is wrongful&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But thou art indeed old, Holy One.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The thing was done. A Cause was put out into the world, and, old or
young, sick or sound, knowing or unknowing, who can rein in the effect of that
Cause? Does the Wheel hang still if a child spin it&mdash;or a drunkard?
<i>Chela</i>, this is a great and a terrible world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it good,&rdquo; Kim yawned. &ldquo;What is there to eat? I have
not eaten since yesterday even.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had forgotten thy need. Yonder is good Bhotiyal tea and cold
rice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We cannot walk far on such stuff.&rdquo; Kim felt all the
European&rsquo;s lust for flesh-meat, which is not accessible in a Jain temple.
Yet, instead of going out at once with the begging-bowl, he stayed his stomach
on slabs of cold rice till the full dawn. It brought the farmer, voluble,
stuttering with gratitude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the night the fever broke and the sweat came,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Feel here&mdash;his skin is fresh and new! He esteemed the salt
lozenges, and took milk with greed.&rdquo; He drew the cloth from the
child&rsquo;s face, and it smiled sleepily at Kim. A little knot of Jain
priests, silent but all-observant, gathered by the temple door. They knew, and
Kim knew that they knew, how the old lama had met his disciple. Being courteous
folk, they had not obtruded themselves overnight by presence, word, or gesture.
Wherefore Kim repaid them as the sun rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank the Gods of the Jains, brother,&rdquo; he said, not knowing how
those Gods were named. &ldquo;The fever is indeed broken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look! See!&rdquo; The lama beamed in the background upon his hosts of
three years. &ldquo;Was there ever such a <i>chela?</i> He follows our Lord the
Healer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now the Jains officially recognize all the Gods of the Hindu creed, as well as
the Lingam and the Snake. They wear the Brahminical thread; they adhere to
every claim of Hindu caste-law. But, because they knew and loved the lama,
because he was an old man, because he sought the Way, because he was their
guest, and because he collogued long of nights with the head-priest&mdash;as
free-thinking a metaphysician as ever split one hair into seventy&mdash;they
murmured assent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo;&mdash;Kim bent over the child&mdash;. &ldquo;this
trouble may come again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not if thou hast the proper spell,&rdquo; said the father.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But in a little while we go away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the lama to all the Jains. &ldquo;We go now together
upon the Search whereof I have often spoken. I waited till my <i>chela</i> was
ripe. Behold him! We go North. Never again shall I look upon this place of my
rest, O people of good will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I am not a beggar.&rdquo; The cultivator rose to his feet, clutching
the child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be still. Do not trouble the Holy One,&rdquo; a priest cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; Kim whispered. &ldquo;Meet us again under the big railway
bridge, and for the sake of all the Gods of our Punjab, bring food&mdash;curry,
pulse, cakes fried in fat, and sweetmeats. Specially sweetmeats. Be
swift!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The pallor of hunger suited Kim very well as he stood, tall and slim, in his
sand-coloured, sweeping robes, one hand on his rosary and the other in the
attitude of benediction, faithfully copied from the lama. An English observer
might have said that he looked rather like the young saint of a stained-glass
window, whereas he was but a growing lad faint with emptiness.
</p>

<p>
Long and formal were the farewells, thrice ended and thrice renewed. The
Seeker&mdash;he who had invited the lama to that haven from far-away Tibet, a
silver-faced, hairless ascetic&mdash;took no part in it, but meditated, as
always, alone among the images. The others were very human; pressing small
comforts upon the old man&mdash;a betel-box, a fine new iron pencase, a
food-bag, and such-like&mdash;warning him against the dangers of the world
without, and prophesying a happy end to the Search. Meantime Kim, lonelier than
ever, squatted on the steps, and swore to himself in the language of St
Xavier&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it is my own fault,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;With Mahbub, I ate
Mahbub&rsquo;s bread, or Lurgan Sahib&rsquo;s. At St Xavier&rsquo;s, three
meals a day. Here I must jolly-well look out for myself. Besides, I am not in
good training. <i>How</i> I could eat a plate of beef now! ... Is it finished,
Holy One?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama, both hands raised, intoned a final blessing in ornate Chinese.
&ldquo;I must lean on thy shoulder,&rdquo; said he, as the temple gates closed.
&ldquo;We grow stiff, I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The weight of a six-foot man is not light to steady through miles of crowded
streets, and Kim, loaded down with bundles and packages for the way, was glad
to reach the shadow of the railway bridge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here we eat,&rdquo; he said resolutely, as the Kamboh, blue-robed and
smiling, hove in sight, a basket in one hand and the child in the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fall to, Holy Ones!&rdquo; he cried from fifty yards. (They were by the
shoal under the first bridge-span, out of sight of hungry priests.) &ldquo;Rice
and good curry, cakes all warm and well scented with <i>hing</i> (asafœtida),
curds and sugar. King of my fields,&rdquo;&mdash;this to the small
son&mdash;&ldquo;let us show these holy men that we Jats of Jullundur can pay a
service ... I had heard the Jains would eat nothing that they had not cooked,
but truly&rdquo;&mdash;he looked away politely over the broad
river&mdash;&ldquo;where there is no eye there is no caste.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And we,&rdquo; said Kim, turning his back and heaping a leafplatter for
the lama, &ldquo;are beyond all castes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They gorged themselves on the good food in silence. Nor till he had licked the
last of the sticky sweetstuff from his little finger did Kim note that the
Kamboh too was girt for travel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If our roads lie together,&rdquo; he said roughly, &ldquo;I go with
thee. One does not often find a worker of miracles, and the child is still
weak. But I am not altogether a reed.&rdquo; He picked up his
<i>lathi</i>&mdash;a five-foot male-bamboo ringed with bands of polished
iron&mdash;and flourished it in the air. &ldquo;The Jats are called
quarrel-some, but that is not true. Except when we are crossed, we are like our
own buffaloes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;A good stick is a good reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama gazed placidly up-stream, where in long, smudged perspective the
ceaseless columns of smoke go up from the burning-ghats by the river. Now and
again, despite all municipal regulations, the fragment of a half-burned body
bobbed by on the full current.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But for thee,&rdquo; said the Kamboh to Kim, drawing the child into his
hairy breast, &ldquo;I might today have gone thither&mdash;with this one. The
priests tell us that Benares is holy&mdash;which none doubt&mdash;and desirable
to die in. But I do not know their Gods, and they ask for money; and when one
has done one worship a shaved-head vows it is of none effect except one do
another. Wash here! Wash there! Pour, drink, lave, and scatter
flowers&mdash;but always pay the priests. No, the Punjab for me, and the soil
of the Jullundur-<i>doab</i> for the best soil in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have said many times&mdash;in the Temple, I think&mdash;that if need
be, the River will open at our feet. We will therefore go North,&rdquo; said
the lama, rising. &ldquo;I remember a pleasant place, set about with
fruit-trees, where one can walk in meditation&mdash;and the air is cooler
there. It comes from the Hills and the snow of the Hills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the name?&rdquo; said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How should I know? Didst thou not&mdash;no, that was after the Army rose
out of the earth and took thee away. I abode there in meditation in a room
against the dovecot&mdash;except when she talked eternally.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho! the woman from Kulu. That is by Saharunpore.&rdquo; Kim laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How does the spirit move thy master? Does he go afoot, for the sake of
past sins?&rdquo; the Jat demanded cautiously. &ldquo;It is a far cry to
Delhi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;I will beg a <i>tikkut</i> for the
<i>te-rain</i>.&rdquo; One does not own to the possession of money in India.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, in the name of the Gods, let us take the fire-carriage. My son is
best in his mother&rsquo;s arms. The Government has brought on us many taxes,
but it gives us one good thing&mdash;the <i>te-rain</i> that joins friends and
unites the anxious. A wonderful matter is the <i>te-rain</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They all piled into it a couple of hours later, and slept through the heat of
the day. The Kamboh plied Kim with ten thousand questions as to the
lama&rsquo;s walk and work in life, and received some curious answers. Kim was
content to be where he was, to look out upon the flat North-Western landscape,
and to talk to the changing mob of fellow-passengers. Even today, tickets and
ticket-clipping are dark oppression to Indian rustics. They do not understand
why, when they have paid for a magic piece of paper, strangers should punch
great pieces out of the charm. So, long and furious are the debates between
travellers and Eurasian ticket-collectors. Kim assisted at two or three with
grave advice, meant to darken counsel and to show off his wisdom before the
lama and the admiring Kamboh. But at Somna Road the Fates sent him a matter to
think upon. There tumbled into the compartment, as the train was moving off, a
mean, lean little person&mdash;a Mahratta, so far as Kim could judge by the
cock of the tight turban. His face was cut, his muslin upper-garment was badly
torn, and one leg was bandaged. He told them that a country-cart had upset and
nearly slain him: he was going to Delhi, where his son lived. Kim watched him
closely. If, as he asserted, he had been rolled over and over on the earth,
there should have been signs of gravel-rash on the skin. But all his injuries
seemed clean cuts, and a mere fall from a cart could not cast a man into such
extremity of terror. As, with shaking fingers, he knotted up the torn cloth
about his neck he laid bare an amulet of the kind called a keeper-up of the
heart. Now, amulets are common enough, but they are not generally strung on
square-plaited copper wire, and still fewer amulets bear black enamel on
silver. There were none except the Kamboh and the lama in the compartment,
which, luckily, was of an old type with solid ends. Kim made as to scratch in
his bosom, and thereby lifted his own amulet. The Mahratta&rsquo;s face changed
altogether at the sight, and he disposed the amulet fairly on his breast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on to the Kamboh, &ldquo;I was in haste, and the
cart, driven by a bastard, bound its wheel in a water-cut, and besides the harm
done to me there was lost a full dish of <i>tarkeean</i>. I was not a Son of
the Charm [a lucky man] that day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was a great loss,&rdquo; said the Kamboh, withdrawing interest. His
experience of Benares had made him suspicious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who cooked it?&rdquo; said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A woman.&rdquo; The Mahratta raised his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But all women can cook <i>tarkeean</i>,&rdquo; said the Kamboh.
&ldquo;It is a good curry, as I know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, it is a good curry,&rdquo; said the Mahratta.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And cheap,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;But what about caste?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there is no caste where men go to&mdash;look for
<i>tarkeean</i>,&rdquo; the Mahratta replied, in the prescribed cadence.
&ldquo;Of whose service art thou?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of the service of this Holy One.&rdquo; Kim pointed to the happy, drowsy
lama, who woke with a jerk at the well-loved word.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, he was sent from Heaven to aid me. He is called the Friend of all
the World. He is also called the Friend of the Stars. He walks as a
physician&mdash;his time being ripe. Great is his wisdom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And a Son of the Charm,&rdquo; said Kim under his breath, as the Kamboh
made haste to prepare a pipe lest the Mahratta should beg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who is <i>that?</i>&rdquo; the Mahratta asked, glancing sideways
nervously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One whose child I&mdash;we have cured, who lies under great debt to us.
Sit by the window, man from Jullundur. Here is a sick one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humph! <i>I</i> have no desire to mix with chance-met wastrels.
<i>My</i> ears are not long. <i>I</i> am not a woman wishing to overhear
secrets.&rdquo; The Jat slid himself heavily into a far corner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Art thou anything of a healer? I am ten leagues deep in calamity,&rdquo;
cried the Mahratta, picking up the cue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This man is cut and bruised all over. I go about to cure him,&rdquo; Kim
retorted. &ldquo;None interfered between thy babe and me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am rebuked,&rdquo; said the Kamboh meekly. &ldquo;I am thy debtor for
the life of my son. Thou art a miracle-worker&mdash;I know it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Show me the cuts.&rdquo; Kim bent over the Mahratta&rsquo;s neck, his
heart nearly choking him; for this was the Great Game with a vengeance.
&ldquo;Now, tell thy tale swiftly, brother, while I say a charm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I come from the South, where my work lay. One of us they slew by the
roadside. Hast thou heard?&rdquo; Kim shook his head. He, of course, knew
nothing of E&rsquo;s predecessor, slain down South in the habit of an Arab
trader. &ldquo;Having found a certain letter which I was sent to seek, I came
away. I escaped from the city and ran to Mhow. So sure was I that none knew, I
did not change my face. At Mhow a woman brought charge against me of theft of
jewellery in that city which I had left. Then I saw the cry was out against me.
I ran from Mhow by night, bribing the police, who had been bribed to hand me
over without question to my enemies in the South. Then I lay in old Chitor city
a week, a penitent in a temple, but I could not get rid of the letter which was
my charge. I buried it under the Queen&rsquo;s Stone, at Chitor, in the place
known to us all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim did not know, but not for worlds would he have broken the thread.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At Chitor, look you, I was all in Kings&rsquo; country; for Kotah to the
east is beyond the Queen&rsquo;s law, and east again lie Jaipur and Gwalior.
Neither love spies, and there is no justice. I was hunted like a wet jackal;
but I broke through at Bandakui, where I heard there was a charge against me of
murder in the city I had left&mdash;of the murder of a boy. They have both the
corpse and the witnesses waiting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But cannot the Government protect?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We of the Game are beyond protection. If we die, we die. Our names are
blotted from the book. That is all. At Bandakui, where lives one of Us, I
thought to slip the scent by changing my face, and so made me a Mahratta. Then
I came to Agra, and would have turned back to Chitor to recover the letter. So
sure I was I had slipped them. Therefore I did not send a tar [telegram] to any
one saying where the letter lay. I wished the credit of it all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim nodded. He understood that feeling well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But at Agra, walking in the streets, a man cried a debt against me, and
approaching with many witnesses, would hale me to the courts then and there.
Oh, they are clever in the South! He recognized me as his agent for cotton. May
he burn in Hell for it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And wast thou?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O fool! I was the man they sought for the matter of the letter! I ran
into the Fleshers&rsquo; Ward and came out by the House of the Jew, who feared
a riot and pushed me forth. I came afoot to Somna Road&mdash;I had only money
for my <i>tikkut</i> to Delhi&mdash;and there, while I lay in a ditch with a
fever, one sprang out of the bushes and beat me and cut me and searched me from
head to foot. Within earshot of the <i>te-rain</i> it was!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did he not slay thee out of hand?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are not so foolish. If I am taken in Delhi at the instance of
lawyers, upon a proven charge of murder, my body is handed over to the State
that desires it. I go back guarded, and then&mdash;I die slowly for an example
to the rest of Us. The South is not my country. I run in circles&mdash;like a
goat with one eye. I have not eaten for two days. I am marked&rdquo;&mdash;he
touched the filthy bandage on his leg&mdash;&ldquo;so that they will know me at
Delhi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou art safe in the <i>te-rain</i>, at least.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Live a year at the Great Game and tell me that again! The wires will be
out against me at Delhi, describing every tear and rag upon me. Twenty&mdash;a
hundred, if need be&mdash;will have seen me slay that boy. And thou art
useless!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim knew enough of native methods of attack not to doubt that the case would be
deadly complete&mdash;even to the corpse. The Mahratta twitched his fingers
with pain from time to time. The Kamboh in his corner glared sullenly; the lama
was busy over his beads; and Kim, fumbling doctor-fashion at the man&rsquo;s
neck, thought out his plan between invocations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hast thou a charm to change my shape? Else I am dead. Five&mdash;ten
minutes alone, if I had not been so pressed, and I might&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he cured yet, miracle-worker?&rdquo; said the Kamboh jealously.
&ldquo;Thou hast chanted long enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay. There is no cure for his hurts, as I see, except he sit for three
days in the habit of a <i>bairagi</i>.&rdquo; This is a common penance, often
imposed on a fat trader by his spiritual teacher.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One priest always goes about to make another priest,&rdquo; was the
retort. Like most grossly superstitious folk, the Kamboh could not keep his
tongue from deriding his Church.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will thy son be a priest, then? It is time he took more of my
quinine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We Jats are all buffaloes,&rdquo; said the Kamboh, softening anew.
</p>

<p>
Kim rubbed a finger-tip of bitterness on the child&rsquo;s trusting little
lips. &ldquo;I have asked for nothing,&rdquo; he said sternly to the father,
&ldquo;except food. Dost thou grudge me that? I go to heal another man. Have I
thy leave&mdash;Prince?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Up flew the man&rsquo;s huge paws in supplication. &ldquo;Nay&mdash;nay. Do not
mock me thus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It pleases me to cure this sick one. Thou shalt acquire merit by aiding.
What colour ash is there in thy pipe-bowl? White. That is auspicious. Was there
raw turmeric among thy foodstuffs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Open thy bundle!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was the usual collection of small oddments: bits of cloth, quack medicines,
cheap fairings, a clothful of <i>atta</i>&mdash;greyish, rough-ground native
flour&mdash;twists of down-country tobacco, tawdry pipe-stems, and a packet of
curry-stuff, all wrapped in a quilt. Kim turned it over with the air of a wise
warlock, muttering a Mohammedan invocation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is wisdom I learned from the Sahibs,&rdquo; he whispered to the
lama; and here, when one thinks of his training at Lurgan&rsquo;s, he spoke no
more than the truth. &ldquo;There is a great evil in this man&rsquo;s fortune,
as shown by the Stars, which&mdash;which troubles him. Shall I take it
away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Friend of the Stars, thou hast done well in all things. Let it be at thy
pleasure. Is it another healing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quick! Be quick!&rdquo; gasped the Mahratta. &ldquo;The train may
stop.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A healing against the shadow of death,&rdquo; said Kim, mixing the
Kamboh&rsquo;s flour with the mingled charcoal and tobacco ash in the red-earth
bowl of the pipe. E, without a word, slipped off his turban and shook down his
long black hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is my food&mdash;priest,&rdquo; the jat growled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A buffalo in the temple! Hast thou dared to look even thus far?&rdquo;
said Kim. &ldquo;I must do mysteries before fools; but have a care for thine
eyes. Is there a film before them already? I save the babe, and for return
thou&mdash;oh, shameless!&rdquo; The man flinched at the direct gaze, for Kim
was wholly in earnest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I curse thee, or shall I&mdash;&rdquo; He picked up the outer
cloth of the bundle and threw it over the bowed head. &ldquo;Dare so much as to
think a wish to see, and&mdash;and&mdash;even I cannot save thee. Sit! Be
dumb!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am blind&mdash;dumb. Forbear to curse! Co&mdash;come, child; we will
play a game of hiding. Do not, for my sake, look from under the cloth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see hope,&rdquo; said E23. &ldquo;What is thy scheme?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This comes next,&rdquo; said Kim, plucking the thin body-shirt. E23
hesitated, with all a North-West man&rsquo;s dislike of baring his body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is caste to a cut throat?&rdquo; said Kim, rending it to the waist.
&ldquo;We must make thee a yellow Saddhu all over. Strip&mdash;strip swiftly,
and shake thy hair over thine eyes while I scatter the ash. Now, a caste-mark
on thy forehead.&rdquo; He drew from his bosom the little Survey paint-box and
a cake of crimson lake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Art thou only a beginner?&rdquo; said E23, labouring literally for the
dear life, as he slid out of his body-wrappings and stood clear in the
loin-cloth while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the ash-smeared brow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But two days entered to the Game, brother,&rdquo; Kim replied.
&ldquo;Smear more ash on the bosom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hast thou met&mdash;a physician of sick pearls?&rdquo; He switched out
his long, tight-rolled turban-cloth and, with swiftest hands, rolled it over
and under about his loins into the intricate devices of a Saddhu&rsquo;s
cincture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hah! Dost thou know his touch, then? He was my teacher for a while. We
must bar thy legs. Ash cures wounds. Smear it again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was his pride once, but thou art almost better. The Gods are kind to
us! Give me <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a tin box of opium pills among the rubbish of the Jat&rsquo;s bundle.
E23 gulped down a half handful. &ldquo;They are good against hunger, fear, and
chill. And they make the eyes red too,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Now I shall
have heart to play the Game. We lack only a Saddhu&rsquo;s tongs. What of the
old clothes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim rolled them small, and stuffed them into the slack folds of his tunic. With
a yellow-ochre paint cake he smeared the legs and the breast, great streaks
against the background of flour, ash, and turmeric.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The blood on them is enough to hang thee, brother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe; but no need to throw them out of the window ... It is
finished.&rdquo; His voice thrilled with a boy&rsquo;s pure delight in the
Game. &ldquo;Turn and look, O Jat!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Gods protect us,&rdquo; said the hooded Kamboh, emerging like a
buffalo from the reeds. &ldquo;But&mdash;whither went the Mahratta? What hast
thou done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim had been trained by Lurgan Sahib; E23, by virtue of his business, was no
bad actor. In place of the tremulous, shrinking trader there lolled against the
corner an all but naked, ash-smeared, ochre-barred, dusty-haired Saddhu, his
swollen eyes&mdash;opium takes quick effect on an empty stomach&mdash;luminous
with insolence and bestial lust, his legs crossed under him, Kim&rsquo;s brown
rosary round his neck, and a scant yard of worn, flowered chintz on his
shoulders. The child buried his face in his amazed father&rsquo;s arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look up, Princeling! We travel with warlocks, but they will not hurt
thee. Oh, do not cry ... What is the sense of curing a child one day and
killing him with fright the next?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The child will be fortunate all his life. He has seen a great healing.
When I was a child I made clay men and horses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have made them too. Sír Banás, he comes in the night and makes them
all alive at the back of our kitchen-midden,&rdquo; piped the child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so thou art not frightened at anything. Eh, Prince?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was frightened because my father was frightened. I felt his arms
shake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, chicken-man!&rdquo; said Kim, and even the abashed Jat laughed.
&ldquo;I have done a healing on this poor trader. He must forsake his gains and
his account-books, and sit by the wayside three nights to overcome the
malignity of his enemies. The Stars are against him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The fewer money-lenders the better, say I; but, Saddhu or no Saddhu, he
should pay for my stuff on his shoulders.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So? But that is thy child on thy shoulder&mdash;given over to the
burning-ghat not two days ago. There remains one thing more. I did this charm
in thy presence because need was great. I changed his shape and his soul. None
the less, if, by any chance, O man from Jullundur, thou rememberest what thou
hast seen, either among the elders sitting under the village tree, or in thine
own house, or in company of thy priest when he blesses thy cattle, a murrain
will come among the buffaloes, and a fire in thy thatch, and rats in the
corn-bins, and the curse of our Gods upon thy fields that they may be barren
before thy feet and after thy ploughshare.&rdquo; This was part of an old curse
picked up from a <i>faquir</i> by the Taksali Gate in the days of Kim&rsquo;s
innocence. It lost nothing by repetition.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cease, Holy One! In mercy, cease!&rdquo; cried the Jat. &ldquo;Do not
curse the household. I saw nothing! I heard nothing! I am thy cow!&rdquo; and
he made to grab at Kim&rsquo;s bare foot beating rhythmically on the carriage
floor. &ldquo;But since thou hast been permitted to aid me in the matter of a
pinch of flour and a little opium and such trifles as I have honoured by using
in my art, so will the Gods return a blessing,&rdquo; and he gave it at length,
to the man&rsquo;s immense relief. It was one that he had learned from Lurgan
Sahib.
</p>

<p>
The lama stared through his spectacles as he had not stared at the business of
disguisement. &ldquo;Friend of the Stars,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;thou
hast acquired great wisdom. Beware that it do not give birth to pride. No man
having the Law before his eyes speaks hastily of any matter which he has seen
or encountered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no, indeed,&rdquo; cried the farmer, fearful lest the
master should be minded to improve on the pupil. E23, with relaxed mouth, gave
himself up to the opium that is meat, tobacco, and medicine to the spent
Asiatic.
</p>

<p>
So, in a silence of awe and great miscomprehension, they slid into Delhi about
lamp-lighting time.
</p>

</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have found my heart again,&rdquo; said E23, under cover of the
platform&rsquo;s tumult. &ldquo;Hunger and fear make men dazed, or I might have
thought of this escape before. I was right. They come to hunt for me. Thou hast
saved my head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A group of yellow-trousered Punjab policemen, headed by a hot and perspiring
young Englishman, parted the crowd about the carriages. Behind them,
inconspicuous as a cat, ambled a small fat person who looked like a
lawyer&rsquo;s tout.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See the young Sahib reading from a paper. My description is in his
hand,&rdquo; said E23. &ldquo;Thev go carriage by carriage, like fisher-folk
netting a pool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When the procession reached their compartment, E23 was counting his beads with
a steady jerk of the wrist; while Kim jeered at him for being so drugged as to
have lost the ringed fire-tongs which are the Saddhu&rsquo;s distinguishing
mark. The lama, deep in meditation, stared straight before him; and the farmer,
glancing furtively, gathered up his belongings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing here but a parcel of holy-bolies,&rdquo; said the Englishman
aloud, and passed on amid a ripple of uneasiness; for native police mean
extortion to the native all India over.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The trouble now,&rdquo; whispered E23, &ldquo;lies in sending a wire as
to the place where I hid that letter I was sent to find. I cannot go to the
<i>tar</i>-office in this guise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it not enough I have saved thy neck?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not if the work be left unfinished. Did never the healer of sick pearls
tell thee so? Comes another Sahib! Ah!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was a tallish, sallowish District Superintendent of Police&mdash;belt,
helmet, polished spurs and all&mdash;strutting and twirling his dark moustache.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What fools are these Police Sahibs!&rdquo; said Kim genially.
</p>

<p>
E23 glanced up under his eyelids. &ldquo;It is well said,&rdquo; he muttered in
a changed voice. &ldquo;I go to drink water. Keep my place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He blundered out almost into the Englishman&rsquo;s arms, and was bad-worded in
clumsy Urdu.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Tum mut?</i> You drunk? You mustn&rsquo;t bang about as though Delhi
station belonged to you, my friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
E23, not moving a muscle of his countenance, answered with a stream of the
filthiest abuse, at which Kim naturally rejoiced. It reminded him of the
drummer-boys and the barrack-sweepers at Umballa in the terrible time of his
first schooling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My good fool,&rdquo; the Englishman drawled. &ldquo;<i>Nickle-jao!</i>
Go back to your carriage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Step by step, withdrawing deferentially and dropping his voice, the yellow
Saddhu clomb back to the carriage, cursing the D.S.P. to remotest posterity,
by&mdash;here Kim almost jumped&mdash;by the curse of the Queen&rsquo;s Stone,
by the writing under the Queen&rsquo;s Stone, and by an assortment of Gods with
wholly, new names.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying,&rdquo;&mdash;the Englishman
flushed angrily&mdash;&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s some piece of blasted impertinence.
Come out of that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
E23, affecting to misunderstand, gravely produced his ticket, which the
Englishman wrenched angrily from his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>zoolum!</i> What oppression!&rdquo; growled the Jat from his
corner. &ldquo;All for the sake of a jest too.&rdquo; He had been grinning at
the freedom of the Saddhu&rsquo;s tongue. &ldquo;Thy charms do not work well
today, Holy One!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Saddhu followed the policeman, fawning and supplicating. The ruck of
passengers, busy, with their babies and their bundles, had not noticed the
affair. Kim slipped out behind him; for it flashed through his head that he had
heard this angry, stupid Sahib discoursing loud personalities to an old lady
near Umballa three years ago.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is well&rdquo;, the Saddhu whispered, jammed in the calling,
shouting, bewildered press&mdash;a Persian greyhound between his feet and a
cageful of yelling hawks under charge of a Rajput falconer in the small of his
back. &ldquo;He has gone now to send word of the letter which I hid. They told
me he was in Peshawur. I might have known that he is like the
crocodile&mdash;always at the other ford. He has saved me from present
calamity, but I owe my life to thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he also one of Us?&rdquo; Kim ducked under a Mewar
camel-driver&rsquo;s greasy armpit and cannoned off a covey of jabbering Sikh
matrons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not less than the greatest. We are both fortunate! I will make report to
him of what thou hast done. I am safe under his protection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He bored through the edge of the crowd besieging the carriages, and squatted by
the bench near the telegraph-office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Return, or they take thy place! Have no fear for the work,
brother&mdash;or my life. Thou hast given me breathing-space, and Strickland
Sahib has pulled me to land. We may work together at the Game yet.
Farewell!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim hurried to his carriage: elated, bewildered, but a little nettled in that
he had no key to the secrets about him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am only a beginner at the Game, that is sure. <i>I</i> could not have
leaped into safety as did the Saddhu. He knew it was darkest under the lamp.
<i>I</i> could not have thought to tell news under pretence of cursing ... and
how clever was the Sahib! No matter, I saved the life of one ... Where is the
Kamboh gone, Holy One?&rdquo; he whispered, as he took his seat in the now
crowded compartment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fear gripped him,&rdquo; the lama replied, with a touch of tender
malice. &ldquo;He saw thee change the Mahratta to a Saddhu in the twinkling of
an eye, as a protection against evil. That shook him. Then he saw the Saddhu
fall sheer into the hands of the <i>polis</i>&mdash;all the effect of thy art.
Then he gathered up his son and fled; for he said that thou didst change a
quiet trader into an impudent bandier of words with the Sahibs, and he feared a
like fate. Where is the Saddhu?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With the <i>polis</i>,&rdquo; said Kim ... &ldquo;Yet I saved the
Kamboh&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama snuffed blandly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, <i>chela</i>, see how thou art overtaken! Thou didst cure the
Kamboh&rsquo;s child solely to acquire merit. But thou didst put a spell on the
Mahratta with prideful workings&mdash;I watched thee&mdash;and with sidelong
glances to bewilder an old old man and a foolish farmer: whence calamity and
suspicion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim controlled himself with an effort beyond his years. Not more than any other
youngster did he like to eat dirt or to be misjudged, but he saw himself in a
cleft stick. The train rolled out of Delhi into the night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Where I have offended thee I have
done wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is more, <i>chela</i>. Thou hast loosed an Act upon the world, and as
a stone thrown into a pool so spread the consequences thou canst not tell how
far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This ignorance was well both for Kim&rsquo;s vanity and for the lama&rsquo;s
peace of mind, when we think that there was then being handed in at Simla a
code-wire reporting the arrival of E23 at Delhi, and, more important, the
whereabouts of a letter he had been commissioned to&mdash;abstract.
Incidentally, an over-zealous policeman had arrested, on charge of murder done
in a far southern State, a horribly indignant Ajmir cotton-broker, who was
explaining himself to a Mr Strickland on Delhi platform, while E23 was paddling
through byways into the locked heart of Delhi city. In two hours several
telegrams had reached the angry minister of a southern State reporting that all
trace of a somewhat bruised Mahratta had been lost; and by the time the
leisurely train halted at Saharunpore the last ripple of the stone Kim had
helped to heave was lapping against the steps of a mosque in far-away
Roum&mdash;where it disturbed a pious man at prayers.
</p>

<p>
The lama made his in ample form near the dewy bougainvillea-trellis near the
platform, cheered by the clear sunshine and the presence of his disciple.
&ldquo;We will put these things behind us,&rdquo; he said, indicating the
brazen engine and the gleaming track. &ldquo;The jolting of the
<i>te-rain</i>&mdash;though a wonderful thing&mdash;has turned my bones to
water. We will use clean air henceforward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us go to the Kulu woman&rsquo;s house&rdquo; said Kim, and stepped
forth cheerily under the bundles. Early morning Saharunpore-way is clean and
well scented. He thought of the other mornings at St Xavier&rsquo;s, and it
topped his already thrice-heaped contentment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is this new haste born from? Wise men do not run about like
chickens in the sun. We have come hundreds upon hundreds of <i>kos</i> already,
and, till now, I have scarcely been alone with thee an instant. How canst thou
receive instruction all jostled of crowds? How can I, whelmed by a flux of
talk, meditate upon the Way?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her tongue grows no shorter with the years, then?&rdquo; the disciple
smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor her desire for charms. I remember once when I spoke of the Wheel of
Life&rdquo;&mdash;the lama fumbled in his bosom for his latest
copy&mdash;&ldquo;she was only curious about the devils that besiege children.
She shall acquire merit by entertaining us&mdash;in a little while&mdash;at an
after-occasion&mdash;softly, softly. Now we will wander loose-foot, waiting
upon the Chain of Things. The Search is sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So they travelled very easily across and among the broad bloomful
fruit-gardens&mdash;by way of Aminabad, Sahaigunge, Akrola of the Ford, and
little Phulesa&mdash;the line of the Siwaliks always to the north, and behind
them again the snows. After long, sweet sleep under the dry stars came the
lordly, leisurely passage through a waking village&mdash;begging-bowl held
forth in silence, but eyes roving in defiance of the Law from sky&rsquo;s edge
to sky&rsquo;s edge. Then would Kim return soft-footed through the soft dust to
his master under the shadow of a mango-tree or the thinner shade of a white
Doon <i>siris</i>, to eat and drink at ease. At mid-day, after talk and a
little wayfaring, they slept; meeting the world refreshed when the air was
cooler. Night found them adventuring into new territory&mdash;some chosen
village spied three hours before across the fat land, and much discussed upon
the road.
</p>

<p>
There they told their tale&mdash;a new one each evening so far as Kim was
concerned&mdash;and there were they made welcome, either by priest or headman,
after the custom of the kindly East.
</p>

<p>
When the shadows shortened and the lama leaned more heavily upon Kim, there was
always the Wheel of Life to draw forth, to hold flat under wiped stones, and
with a long straw to expound cycle by cycle. Here sat the Gods on
high&mdash;and they were dreams of dreams. Here was our Heaven and the world of
the demi-Gods&mdash;horsemen fighting among the hills. Here were the agonies
done upon the beasts, souls ascending or descending the ladder and therefore
not to be interfered with. Here were the Hells, hot and cold, and the abodes of
tormented ghosts. Let the <i>chela</i> study the troubles that come from
over-eating&mdash;bloated stomach and burning bowels. Obediently, then, with
bowed head and brown finger alert to follow the pointer, did the <i>chela</i>
study; but when they came to the Human World, busy and profitless, that is just
above the Hells, his mind was distracted; for by the roadside trundled the very
Wheel itself, eating, drinking, trading, marrying, and quarrelling&mdash;all
warmly alive. Often the lama made the living pictures the matter of his text,
bidding Kim&mdash;too ready&mdash;note how the flesh takes a thousand shapes,
desirable or detestable as men reckon, but in truth of no account either way;
and how the stupid spirit, bond-slave to the Hog, the Dove, and the
Serpent&mdash;lusting after betel-nut, a new yoke of oxen, women, or the favour
of kings&mdash;is bound to follow the body through all the Heavens and all the
Hells, and strictly round again. Sometimes a woman or a poor man, watching the
ritual&mdash;it was nothing less&mdash;when the great yellow chart was
unfolded, would throw a few flowers or a handful of cowries upon its edge. It
sufficed these humble ones that they had met a Holy One who might be moved to
remember them in his prayers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cure them if they are sick,&rdquo; said the lama, when Kim&rsquo;s
sporting instincts woke. &ldquo;Cure them if they have fever, but by no means
work charms. Remember what befell the Mahratta.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then all Doing is evil?&rdquo; Kim replied, lying out under a big tree
at the fork of the Doon road, watching the little ants run over his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To abstain from action is well&mdash;except to acquire merit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from action was
unbefitting a Sahib. And I am a Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Friend of all the World,&rdquo;&mdash;the lama looked directly at
Kim&mdash;&ldquo;I am an old man&mdash;pleased with shows as are children. To
those who follow the Way there is neither black nor white, Hind nor Bhotiyal.
We be all souls seeking escape. No matter what thy wisdom learned among Sahibs,
when we come to my River thou wilt be freed from all illusion&mdash;at my side.
Hai! My bones ache for that River, as they ached in the <i>te-rain;</i> but my
spirit sits above my bones, waiting. The Search is sure!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am answered. Is it permitted to ask a question?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama inclined his stately head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ate thy bread for three years&mdash;as thou knowest. Holy One, whence
came&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is much wealth, as men count it, in Bhotiyal,&rdquo; the lama
returned with composure. &ldquo;In my own place I have the illusion of honour.
I ask for that I need. I am not concerned with the account. That is for my
monastery. Ai! The black high seats in the monastery, and novices all in
order!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And he told stories, tracing with a finger in the dust, of the immense and
sumptuous ritual of avalanche-guarded cathedrals; of processions and
devil-dances; of the changing of monks and nuns into swine; of holy cities
fifteen thousand feet in the air; of intrigue between monastery and monastery;
of voices among the hills, and of that mysterious mirage that dances on dry
snow. He spoke even of Lhassa and of the Dalai Lama, whom he had seen and
adored.
</p>

<p>
Each long, perfect day rose behind Kim for a barrier to cut him off from his
race and his mother-tongue. He slipped back to thinking and dreaming in the
vernacular, and mechanically followed the lama&rsquo;s ceremonial observances
at eating, drinking, and the like. The old man&rsquo;s mind turned more and
more to his monastery as his eyes turned to the steadfast snows. His River
troubled him nothing. Now and again, indeed, he would gaze long and long at a
tuft or a twig, expecting, he said, the earth to cleave and deliver its
blessing; but he was content to be with his disciple, at ease in the temperate
wind that comes down from the Doon. This was not Ceylon, nor Buddh Gaya, nor
Bombay, nor some grass-tangled ruins that he seemed to have stumbled upon two
years ago. He spoke of those places as a scholar removed from vanity, as a
Seeker walking in humility, as an old man, wise and temperate, illumining
knowledge with brilliant insight. Bit by bit, disconnectedly, each tale called
up by some wayside thing, he spoke of all his wanderings up and down Hind; till
Kim, who had loved him without reason, now loved him for fifty good reasons. So
they enjoyed themselves in high felicity, abstaining, as the Rule demands, from
evil words, covetous desires; not over-eating, not lying on high beds, nor
wearing rich clothes. Their stomachs told them the time, and the people brought
them their food, as the saying is. They were lords of the villages of Aminabad,
Sahaigunge, Akrola of the Ford, and little Phulesa, where Kim gave the soulless
woman a blessing.
</p>

<p>
But news travels fast in India, and too soon shuffled across the crop-land,
bearing a basket of fruits with a box of Kabul grapes and gilt oranges, a
white-whiskered servitor&mdash;a lean, dry Oorya&mdash;begging them to bring
the honour of their presence to his mistress, distressed in her mind that the
lama had neglected her so long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now do I remember&rdquo;&mdash;the lama spoke as though it were a wholly
new proposition. &ldquo;She is virtuous, but an inordinate talker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim was sitting on the edge of a cow&rsquo;s manger, telling stories to a
village smith&rsquo;s children.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She will only ask for another son for her daughter. I have not forgotten
her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let her acquire merit. Send word that we will
come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They covered eleven miles through the fields in two days, and were overwhelmed
with attentions at the end; for the old lady held a fine tradition of
hospitality, to which she forced her son-in-law, who was under the thumb of his
women-folk and bought peace by borrowing of the money-lender. Age had not
weakened her tongue or her memory, and from a discreetly barred upper window,
in the hearing of not less than a dozen servants, she paid Kim compliments that
would have flung European audiences into unclean dismay.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But thou art still the shameless beggar-brat of the <i>parao</i>,&rdquo;
she shrilled. &ldquo;I have not forgotten thee. Wash ye and eat. The father of
my daughter&rsquo;s son is gone away awhile. So we poor women are dumb and
useless.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For proof, she harangued the entire household unsparingly till food and drink
were brought; and in the evening&mdash;the smoke-scented evening, copper-dun
and turquoise across the fields&mdash;it pleased her to order her palanquin to
be set down in the untidy forecourt by smoky torchlight; and there, behind not
too closely drawn curtains, she gossiped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Had the Holy One come alone, I should have received him otherwise; but
with this rogue, who can be too careful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maharanee,&rdquo; said Kim, choosing as always the amplest title,
&ldquo;is it my fault that none other than a Sahib&mdash;a
<i>polis</i>-sahib&mdash;called the Maharanee whose face he&mdash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Chutt! That was on the pilgrimage. When we travel&mdash;thou knowest the
proverb.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Called the Maharanee a Breaker of Hearts and a Dispenser of
Delights?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To remember that! It was true. So he did. That was in the time of the
bloom of my beauty.&rdquo; She chuckled like a contented parrot above the sugar
lump. &ldquo;Now tell me of thy goings and comings&mdash;as much as may be
without shame. How many maids, and whose wives, hang upon thine eyelashes? Ye
hail from Benares? I would have gone there again this year, but my
daughter&mdash;we have only two sons. Phaii! Such is the effect of these low
plains. Now in Kulu men are elephants. But I would ask thy Holy One&mdash;stand
aside, rogue&mdash;a charm against most lamentable windy colics that in
mango-time overtake my daughter&rsquo;s eldest. Two years back he gave me a
powerful spell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Holy One!&rdquo; said Kim, bubbling with mirth at the lama&rsquo;s
rueful face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is true. I gave her one against wind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Teeth&mdash;teeth&mdash;teeth,&rdquo; snapped the old woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cure them if they are sick,&rsquo;&rdquo; Kim quoted relishingly,
&lsquo;&ldquo;but by no means work charms. Remember what befell the
Mahratta.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was two Rains ago; she wearied me with her continual
importunity.&rdquo; The lama groaned as the Unjust Judge had groaned before
him. &ldquo;Thus it comes&mdash;take note, my <i>chela</i>&mdash;that even
those who would follow the Way are thrust aside by idle women. Three days
through, when the child was sick, she talked to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Arre! and to whom else should I talk? The boy&rsquo;s mother knew
nothing, and the father&mdash;in the nights of the cold weather it
was&mdash;&lsquo;Pray to the Gods,&rsquo; said he, forsooth, and turning over,
snored!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I gave her the charm. What is an old man to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;To abstain from action is well&mdash;except to acquire
merit.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah <i>chela</i>, if thou desertest me, I am all alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He found his milk-teeth easily at any rate,&rdquo; said the old lady.
&ldquo;But all priests are alike.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim coughed severely. Being young, he did not approve of her flippancy.
&ldquo;To importune the wise out of season is to invite calamity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is a talking <i>mynah</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the thrust came back with
the well-remembered snap of the jewelled fore-finger&mdash;&ldquo;over the
stables which has picked up the very tone of the family priest. Maybe I forget
honour to my guests, but if ye had seen <i>him</i> double his fists into his
belly, which was like a half-grown gourd, and cry: &lsquo;Here is the
pain!&rsquo; ye would forgive. I am half minded to take the
<i>hakim&rsquo;s</i> medicine. He sells it cheap, and certainly it makes him
fat as Shiv&rsquo;s own bull. <i>He</i> does not deny remedies, but I doubted
for the child because of the in-auspicious colour of the bottles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama, under cover of the monologue, had faded out into the darkness towards
the room prepared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou hast angered him, belike,&rdquo; said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not he. He is wearied, and I forgot, being a grandmother. (None but a
grandmother should ever oversee a child. Mothers are only fit for bearing.)
Tomorrow, when he sees how my daughter&rsquo;s son is grown, he will write the
charm. Then, too, he can judge of the new <i>hakim&rsquo;s</i> drugs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is the <i>hakim</i>, Maharanee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A wanderer, as thou art, but a most sober Bengali from Dacca&mdash;a
master of medicine. He relieved me of an oppression after meat by means of a
small pill that wrought like a devil unchained. He travels about now, vending
preparations of great value. He has even papers, printed in Angrezi, telling
what things he has done for weak-backed men and slack women. He has been here
four days; but hearing ye were coming (<i>hakims</i> and priests are snake and
tiger the world over) he has, as I take it, gone to cover.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While she drew breath after this volley, the ancient servant, sitting unrebuked
on the edge of the torchlight, muttered: &ldquo;This house is a cattle-pound,
as it were, for all charlatans and&mdash;priests. Let the boy stop eating
mangoes ... but who can argue with a grandmother?&rdquo; He raised his voice
respectfully: &ldquo;Sahiba, the <i>hakim</i> sleeps after his meat. He is in
the quarters behind the dovecote.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim bristled like an expectant terrier. To outface and down-talk a
Calcutta-taught Bengali, a voluble Dacca drug-vendor, would be a good game. It
was not seemly that the lama, and incidentally himself, should be thrown aside
for such an one. He knew those curious bastard English advertisements at the
backs of native newspapers. St Xavier&rsquo;s boys sometimes brought them in by
stealth to snigger over among their mates; for the language of the grateful
patient recounting his symptoms is most simple and revealing. The Oorya, not
unanxious to play off one parasite against the other, slunk away towards the
dovecote.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kim, with measured scorn. &ldquo;Their stock-in-trade
is a little coloured water and a very great shamelessness. Their prey are
broken-down kings and overfed Bengalis. Their profit is in children&mdash;who
are not born.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady chuckled. &ldquo;Do not be envious. Charms are better, eh?
<i>I</i> never gainsaid it. See that thy Holy One writes me a good amulet by
the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None but the ignorant deny&rdquo;&mdash;a thick, heavy voice boomed
through the darkness, as a figure came to rest squatting&mdash;&ldquo;None but
the ignorant deny the value of charms. None but the ignorant deny the value of
medicines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A rat found a piece of turmeric. Said he: &lsquo;I will open a
grocer&rsquo;s shop,&rsquo;&rdquo; Kim retorted.
</p>

<p>
Battle was fairly joined now, and they heard the old lady stiffen to attention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The priest&rsquo;s son knows the names of his nurse and three Gods. Says
he: &lsquo;Hear me, or I will curse you by the three million Great
Ones.&rsquo;&rdquo; Decidedly this invisible had an arrow or two in his quiver.
He went on: &ldquo;I am but a teacher of the alphabet. I have learned all the
wisdom of the Sahibs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Sahibs never grow old. They dance and they play like children when
they are grandfathers. A strong-backed breed,&rdquo; piped the voice inside the
palanquin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have, too, our drugs which loosen humours of the head in hot and angry
men. <i>Siná</i> well compounded when the moon stands in the proper House;
yellow earths I have&mdash;<i>arplan</i> from China that makes a man renew his
youth and astonish his household; saffron from Kashmir, and the best salep of
Kabul. Many people have died before&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I surely believe,&rdquo; said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They knew the value of my drugs. I do not give <i>my</i> sick the mere
ink in which a charm is written, but hot and rending drugs which descend and
wrestle with the evil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very mightily they do so,&rdquo; sighed the old lady.
</p>

<p>
The voice launched into an immense tale of misfortune and bankruptcy, studded
with plentiful petitions to the Government. &ldquo;But for my fate, which
overrules all, I had been now in Government employ. I bear a degree from the
great school at Calcutta&mdash;whither, maybe, the son of this House shall
go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He shall indeed. If our neighbour&rsquo;s brat can in a few years be
made an F A&rdquo; (First Arts&mdash;she used the English word, of which she
had heard so often), &ldquo;how much more shall children clever as some that I
know bear away prizes at rich Calcutta.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;have I seen such a child! Born in
an auspicious hour, and&mdash;but for that colic which, alas! turning into
black cholers, may carry him off like a pigeon&mdash;destined to many years, he
is enviable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Hai mai!</i>&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;To praise children is
inauspicious, or I could listen to this talk. But the back of the house is
unguarded, and even in this soft air men think themselves to be men, and women
we know ... The child&rsquo;s father is away too, and I must be
<i>chowkedar</i> (watchman) in my old age. Up! Up! Take up the palanquin. Let
the <i>hakim</i> and the young priest settle between them whether charms or
medicine most avail. Ho! worthless people, fetch tobacco for the guests,
and&mdash;round the homestead go I!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The palanquin reeled off, followed by straggling torches and a horde of dogs.
Twenty villages knew the Sahiba&mdash;her failings, her tongue, and her large
charity. Twenty villages cheated her after immemorial custom, but no man would
have stolen or robbed within her jurisdiction for any gift under heaven. None
the less, she made great parade of her formal inspections, the riot of which
could be heard half-way to Mussoorie.
</p>

<p>
Kim relaxed, as one augur must when he meets another. The <i>hakim</i>, still
squatting, slid over his hookah with a friendly foot, and Kim pulled at the
good weed. The hangers-on expected grave professional debate, and perhaps a
little free doctoring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To discuss medicine before the ignorant is of one piece with teaching
the peacock to sing,&rdquo; said the <i>hakim</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True courtesy,&rdquo; Kim echoed, &ldquo;is very often
inattention.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These, be it understood, were company-manners, designed to impress.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hi! I have an ulcer on my leg,&rdquo; cried a scullion. &ldquo;Look at
it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get hence! Remove!&rdquo; said the <i>hakim</i>. &ldquo;Is it the habit
of the place to pester honoured guests? Ye crowd in like buffaloes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If the Sahiba knew&mdash;&rdquo; Kim began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ai! Ai! Come away. They are meat for our mistress. When her young
Shaitan&rsquo;s colics are cured perhaps we poor people may be suffered
to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mistress fed thy wife when thou wast in jail for breaking the
money-lender&rsquo;s head. Who speaks against her?&rdquo; The old servitor
curled his white moustaches savagely in the young moonlight. &ldquo;<i>I</i> am
responsible for the honour of this house. Go!&rdquo; and he drove the
underlings before him.
</p>

<p>
Said the <i>hakim</i>, hardly more than shaping the words with his lips:
&ldquo;How do you do, Mister O&rsquo;Hara? I am jolly glad to see you
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim&rsquo;s hand clenched about the pipe-stem. Anywhere on the open road,
perhaps, he would not have been astonished; but here, in this quiet backwater
of life, he was not prepared for Hurree Babu. It annoyed him, too, that he had
been hoodwinked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah ha! I told you at Lucknow&mdash;<i>resurgam</i>&mdash;I shall rise
again and you shall not know me. How much did you bet&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He chewed leisurely upon a few cardamom seeds, but he breathed uneasily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why come here, Babuji?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! <i>Thatt</i> is the question, as Shakespeare hath it. I come to
congratulate you on your extraordinary effeecient performance at Delhi. Oah! I
tell you we are all proud of you. It was verree neat and handy. Our mutual
friend, he is old friend of mine. He has been in some dam&rsquo;-tight places.
Now he will be in some more. He told me; I tell Mr Lurgan; and he is pleased
you graduate so nicely. All the Department is pleased.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For the first time in his life, Kim thrilled to the clean pride (it can be a
deadly pitfall, none the less) of Departmental praise&mdash;ensnaring praise
from an equal of work appreciated by fellow-workers. Earth has nothing on the
same plane to compare with it. But, cried the Oriental in him, Babus do not
travel far to retail compliments.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell thy tale, Babu,&rdquo; he said authoritatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah, it is nothing. Onlee I was at Simla when the wire came in about
what our mutual friend said he had hidden, and old Creighton&mdash;&rdquo; He
looked to see how Kim would take this piece of audacity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Colonel Sahib,&rdquo; the boy from St Xavier&rsquo;s corrected.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Of</i> course. He found me at a loose string, and I had to go down to
Chitor to find that beastly letter. I do not like the South&mdash;too much
railway travel; but I drew good travelling allowance. Ha! Ha! I meet our mutual
at Delhi on the way back. He lies quiett just now, and says Saddhu-disguise
suits him to the ground. Well, there I hear what you have done so well, so
quickly, upon the instantaneous spur of the moment. I tell our mutual you take
the bally bun, by Jove! It was splendid. I come to tell you so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Umm!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The frogs were busy in the ditches, and the moon slid to her setting. Some
happy servant had gone out to commune with the night and to beat upon a drum.
Kim&rsquo;s next sentence was in the vernacular.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How didst thou follow us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah. Thatt was nothing. I know from our mutual friend you go to
Saharunpore. So I come on. Red Lamas are not inconspicuous persons. I buy
myself my drug-box, and I am very good doctor really. I go to Akrola of the
Ford, and hear all about you, and I talk here and talk there. All the common
people know what you do. I knew when the hospitable old lady sent the
<i>dooli</i>. They have great recollections of the old lama&rsquo;s visits
here. I know old ladies cannot keep their hands from medicines. So I am a
doctor, and&mdash;you hear my talk? <i>I</i> think it is verree good. My word,
Mister O&rsquo;Hara, they know about you and the lama for fifty miles&mdash;the
common people. So I come. Do you mind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Babuji,&rdquo; said Kim, looking up at the broad, grinning face,
&ldquo;I am a Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Mister O&rsquo;Hara&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I hope to play the Great Game.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are subordinate to me departmentally at present.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why talk like an ape in a tree? Men do not come after one from
Simla and change their dress, for the sake of a few sweet words. I am not a
child. Talk Hindi and let us get to the yolk of the egg. Thou art
here&mdash;speaking not one word of truth in ten. Why art thou here? Give a
straight answer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is so verree disconcerting of the Europeans, Mister O&rsquo;Hara.
<i>You</i> should know a heap better at your time of life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I want to know,&rdquo; said Kim, laughing. &ldquo;If it is the Game,
I may help. How can I do anything if you <i>bukh</i> (babble) all round the
shop?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hurree Babu reached for the pipe, and sucked it till it gurgled again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now I will speak vernacular. You sit tight, Mister O&rsquo;Hara ... It
concerns the pedigree of a white stallion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Still? That was finished long ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When everyone is dead the Great Game is finished. Not before. Listen to
me till the end. There were Five Kings who prepared a sudden war three years
ago, when thou wast given the stallion&rsquo;s pedigree by Mahbub Ali. Upon
them, because of that news, and ere they were ready, fell our Army.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay&mdash;eight thousand men with guns. I remember that night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the war was not pushed. That is the Government custom. The troops
were recalled because the Government believed the Five Kings were cowed; and it
is not cheap to feed men among the high Passes. Hilás and Bunár&mdash;Rajahs
with guns&mdash;undertook for a price to guard the Passes against all coming
from the North. They protested both fear and friendship.&rdquo; He broke off
with a giggle into English: &ldquo;Of course, I tell you this unoffeecially to
elucidate political situation, Mister O&rsquo;Hara. Offeecially, I am debarred
from criticizing any action of superiors. Now I go on.&mdash;This pleased the
Government, anxious to avoid expense, and a bond was made for so many rupees a
month that Hilás and Bunár should guard the Passes as soon as the State&rsquo;s
troops were withdrawn. At that time&mdash;it was after we two met&mdash;I, who
had been selling tea in Leh, became a clerk of accounts in the Army. When the
troops were withdrawn, I was left behind to pay the coolies who made new roads
in the Hills. This road-making was part of the bond between Bunár, Hilás, and
the Government.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So? And then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you, it was jolly-beastly cold up there too, after summer,&rdquo;
said Hurree Babu confidentially. &ldquo;I was afraid these Bunár men would cut
my throat every night for thee pay-chest. My native sepoy-guard, they laughed
at me! By Jove! I was such a fearful man. Nevar mind thatt. I go on
colloquially ... I send word many times that these two Kings were sold to the
North; and Mahbub Ali, who was yet farther North, amply confirmed it. Nothing
was done. Only my feet were frozen, and a toe dropped off. I sent word that the
roads for which I was paying money to the diggers were being made for the feet
of strangers and enemies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the Russians. The thing was an open jest among the coolies. Then I
was called down to tell what I knew by speech of tongue. Mahbub came South too.
See the end! Over the Passes this year after snow-melting&rdquo;&mdash;he
shivered afresh&mdash;&ldquo;come two strangers under cover of shooting wild
goats. They bear guns, but they bear also chains and levels and
compasses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho! The thing gets clearer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are well received by Hilás and Bunár. They make great promises;
they speak as the mouthpiece of a Kaisar with gifts. Up the valleys, down the
valleys go they, saying, &lsquo;Here is a place to build a breastwork; here can
ye pitch a fort. Here can ye hold the road against an army&rsquo;&mdash;the
very roads for which I paid out the rupees monthly. The Government knows, but
does nothing. The three other Kings, who were <i>not</i> paid for guarding the
Passes, tell them by runner of the bad faith of Bunár and Hilás. When all the
evil is done, look you&mdash;when these two strangers with the levels and the
compasses make the Five Kings to believe that a great army will sweep the
Passes tomorrow or the next day&mdash;Hill-people are all fools&mdash;comes the
order to me, Hurree Babu, &lsquo;Go North and see what those strangers
do.&rsquo; I say to Creighton Sahib, &lsquo;This is not a lawsuit, that we go
about to collect evidence.&rsquo;&rdquo; Hurree returned to his English with a
jerk: &ldquo;&lsquo;By Jove,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;why the dooce do you not
issue demi-offeecial orders to some brave man to poison them, for an example?
It is, if you permit the observation, most reprehensible laxity on your
part.&rsquo; And Colonel Creighton, he laughed at me! It is all your beastly
English pride. You think no one dare conspire! That is all tommy-rott.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim smoked slowly, revolving the business, so far as he understood it, in his
quick mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then thou goest forth to follow the strangers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. To meet them. They are coming in to Simla to send down their horns
and heads to be dressed at Calcutta. They are exclusively sporting gentlemen,
and they are allowed special faceelities by the Government. Of course, we
always do that. It is our British pride.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what is to fear from them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, they are not black people. I can do all sorts of things with
black people, of course. They are Russians, and highly unscrupulous people.
I&mdash;I do not want to consort with them without a witness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will they kill thee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah, thatt is nothing. I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to
meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know. But&mdash;but
they may beat me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hurree Babu snapped his fingers with irritation. &ldquo;Of <i>course</i> I
shall affeeliate myself to their camp in supernumerary capacity as perhaps
interpreter, or person mentally impotent and hungree, or some such thing. And
then I must pick up what I can, I suppose. That is as easy for me as playing
Mister Doctor to the old lady. Onlee&mdash;onlee&mdash;you see, Mister
O&rsquo;Hara, I am unfortunately Asiatic, which is serious detriment in some
respects. And <i>all</i>so I am Bengali&mdash;a fearful man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God made the Hare and the Bengali. What shame?&rdquo; said Kim, quoting
the proverb.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was process of Evolution, <i>I</i> think, from Primal Necessity, but
the fact remains in all the <i>cui bono</i>. I am, oh, awfully fearful!&mdash;I
remember once they wanted to cut off my head on the road to Lhassa. (No, I have
never reached to Lhassa.) I sat down and cried, Mister O&rsquo;Hara,
anticipating Chinese tortures. I do not suppose these two gentlemen will
torture me, but I like to provide for possible contingency with European
assistance in emergency.&rdquo; He coughed and spat out the cardamoms.
&ldquo;It is purely unoffeecial indent, to which you can say &lsquo;No,
Babu&rsquo;. If you have no pressing engagement with your old man&mdash;perhaps
you might divert him; perhaps I can seduce his fancies&mdash;I should like you
to keep in Departmental touch with me till I find those sporting coves. I have
great opeenion of you since I met my friend at Delhi. And also I will embody
your name in my offeecial report when matter is finally adjudicated. It will be
a great feather in your cap. That is why I come really.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humph! The end of the tale, I think, is true; but what of the
fore-part?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About the Five Kings? Oah! there is ever so much truth in it. A lots
more than you would suppose,&rdquo; said Hurree earnestly. &ldquo;You
come&mdash;eh? I go from here straight into the Doon. It is verree verdant and
painted meads. I shall go to Mussoorie to good old Munsoorie Pahar, as the
gentlemen and ladies say. Then by Rampur into Chini. That is the only way they
can come. I do not like waiting in the cold, but we must wait for them. I want
to walk with them to Simla. You see, one Russian is a Frenchman, and I know my
French pretty well. I have friends in Chandernagore.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>He</i> would certainly rejoice to see the Hills again,&rdquo; said
Kim meditatively. &ldquo;All his speech these ten days past has been of little
else. If we go together&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah! We can be quite strangers on the road, if your lama prefers. I
shall just be four or five miles ahead. There is no hurry for Hurree&mdash;that
is an Europe pun, ha! ha!&mdash;and you come after. There is plenty of time;
they will plot and survey and map, of course. I shall go tomorrow, and you the
next day, if you choose. Eh? You go think on it till morning. By Jove, it is
near morning now.&rdquo; He yawned ponderously, and with never a civil word
lumbered off to his sleeping-place. But Kim slept little, and his thoughts ran
in Hindustani:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well is the Game called great! I was four days a scullion at Quetta,
waiting on the wife of the man whose book I stole. And that was part of the
Great Game! From the South&mdash;God knows how far&mdash;came up the Mahratta,
playing the Great Game in fear of his life. Now I shall go far and far into the
North playing the Great Game. Truly, it runs like a shuttle throughout all
Hind. And my share and my joy&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled to the
darkness&mdash;&ldquo;I owe to the lama here. Also to Mahbub Ali&mdash;also to
Creighton Sahib, but chiefly to the Holy One. He is right&mdash;a great and a
wonderful world&mdash;and I am Kim&mdash;Kim&mdash;Kim&mdash;alone&mdash;one
person&mdash;in the middle of it all. But I will see these strangers with their
levels and chains...&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was the upshot of last night&rsquo;s babble?&rdquo; said the lama,
after his orisons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There came a strolling seller of drugs&mdash;a hanger-on of the
Sahiba&rsquo;s. Him I abolished by arguments and prayers, proving that our
charms are worthier than his coloured waters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas, my charms! Is the virtuous woman still bent upon a new one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very strictly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then it must be written, or she will deafen me with her clamour.&rdquo;
He fumbled at his pencase.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the Plains,&rdquo; said Kim, &ldquo;are always too many people. In
the Hills, as I understand, there are fewer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! the Hills, and the snows upon the Hills.&rdquo; The lami tore off a
tiny square of paper fit to go in an amulet. &ldquo;But what dost thou know of
the Hills?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are very close.&rdquo; Kim thrust open the door and looked at the
long, peaceful line of the Himalayas flushed in morning-gold. &ldquo;Except in
the dress of a Sahib, I have never set foot among them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama snuffed the wind wistfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If we go North,&rdquo;&mdash;Kim put the question to the waking
sunrise&mdash;&ldquo;would not much mid-day heat be avoided by walking among
the lower hills at least? ... Is the charm made, Holy One?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have written the names of seven silly devils&mdash;not one of whom is
worth a grain of dust in the eye. Thus do foolish women drag us from the
Way!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hurree Babu came out from behind the dovecote washing his teeth with
ostentatious ritual. Full-fleshed, heavy-haunched, bull-necked, and
deep-voiced, he did not look like &ldquo;a fearful man&rdquo;. Kim signed
almost imperceptibly that matters were in good train, and when the morning
toilet was over, Hurree Babu, in flowery speech, came to do honour to the lama.
They ate, of course, apart, and afterwards the old lady, more or less veiled
behind a window, returned to the vital business of green-mango colics in the
young. The lama&rsquo;s knowledge of medicine was, of course, sympathetic only.
He believed that the dung of a black horse, mixed with sulphur, and carried in
a snake-skin, was a sound remedy for cholera; but the symbolism interested him
far more than the science. Hurree Babu deferred to these views with enchanting
politeness, so that the lama called him a courteous physician. Hurree Babu
replied that he was no more than an inexpert dabbler in the mysteries; but at
least&mdash;he thanked the Gods therefore&mdash;he knew when he sat in the
presence of a master. He himself had been taught by the Sahibs, who do not
consider expense, in the lordly halls of Calcutta; but, as he was ever first to
acknowledge, there lay a wisdom behind earthly wisdom&mdash;the high and lonely
lore of meditation. Kim looked on with envy. The Hurree Babu of his
knowledge&mdash;oily, effusive, and nervous&mdash;was gone; gone, too, was the
brazen drug-vendor of overnight. There remained&mdash;polished, polite,
attentive&mdash;a sober, learned son of experience and adversity, gathering
wisdom from the lama&rsquo;s lips. The old lady confided to Kim that these rare
levels were beyond her. She liked charms with plenty of ink that one could wash
off in water, swallow, and be done with. Else what was the use of the Gods? She
liked men and women, and she spoke of them&mdash;of kinglets she had known in
the past; of her own youth and beauty; of the depredations of leopards and the
eccentricities of love Asiatic; of the incidence of taxation, rack-renting,
funeral ceremonies, her son-in-law (this by allusion, easy to be followed), the
care of the young, and the age&rsquo;s lack of decency. And Kim, as interested
in the life of this world as she soon to leave it, squatted with his feet under
the hem of his robe, drinking all in, while the lama demolished one after
another every theory of body-curing put forward by Hurree Babu.
</p>

<p>
At noon the Babu strapped up his brass-bound drug-box, took his patent-leather
shoes of ceremony in one hand, a gay blue-and-white umbrella in the other, and
set off northwards to the Doon, where, he said, he was in demand among the
lesser kings of those parts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will go in the cool of the evening, <i>chela</i>,&rdquo; said the
lama. &ldquo;That doctor, learned in physic and courtesy, affirms that the
people among these lower hills are devout, generous, and much in need of a
teacher. In a very short time&mdash;so says the <i>hakim</i>&mdash;we come to
cool air and the smell of pines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye go to the Hills? And by Kulu road? Oh, thrice happy!&rdquo; shrilled
the old lady. &ldquo;But that I am a little pressed with the care of the
homestead I would take palanquin ... but that would be shameless, and my
reputation would be cracked. Ho! Ho! I know the road&mdash;every march of the
road I know. Ye will find charity throughout&mdash;it is not denied to the
well-looking. I will give orders for provision. A servant to set you forth upon
your journey? No ... Then I will at least cook ye good food.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a woman is the Sahiba!&rdquo; said the white-bearded Oorya, when a
tumult rose by the kitchen quarters. &ldquo;She has never forgotten a friend:
she has never forgotten an enemy in all her years. And her
cookery&mdash;wah!&rdquo; He rubbed his slim stomach.
</p>

<p>
There were cakes, there were sweetmeats, there was cold fowl stewed to rags
with rice and prunes&mdash;enough to burden Kim like a mule.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am old and useless,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;None now love me&mdash;and
none respect&mdash;but there are few to compare with me when I call on the Gods
and squat to my cooking-pots. Come again, O people of good will. Holy One and
disciple, come again. The room is always prepared; the welcome is always ready
... See the women do not follow thy <i>chela</i> too openly. I know the women
of Kulu. Take heed, <i>chela</i>, lest he run away when he smells his Hills
again ... Hai! Do not tilt the rice-bag upside down ... Bless the household,
Holy One, and forgive thy servant her stupidities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She wiped her red old eyes on a corner of her veil, and clucked throatily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Women talk,&rdquo; said the lama at last, &ldquo;but that is a
woman&rsquo;s infirmity. I gave her a charm. She is upon the Wheel and wholly
given over to the shows of this life, but none the less, <i>chela</i>, she is
virtuous, kindly, hospitable&mdash;of a whole and zealous heart. Who shall say
she does not acquire merit?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not I, Holy One,&rdquo; said Kim, reslinging the bountiful provision on
his shoulders. &ldquo;In my mind&mdash;behind my eyes&mdash;I have tried to
picture such an one altogether freed from the Wheel&mdash;desiring nothing,
causing nothing&mdash;a nun, as it were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And, O imp?&rdquo; The lama almost laughed aloud.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot make the picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor I. But there are many, many millions of lives before her. She will
get wisdom a little, it may be, in each one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And will she forget how to make stews with saffron upon that
road?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thy mind is set on things unworthy. But she has skill. I am refreshed
all over. When we reach the lower hills I shall be yet stronger. The
<i>hakim</i> spoke truly to me this morn when he said a breath from the snows
blows away twenty years from the life of a man. We will go up into the
Hills&mdash;the high hills&mdash;up to the sound of snow-waters and the sound
of the trees&mdash;for a little while. The <i>hakim</i> said that at any time
we may return to the Plains, for we do no more than skirt the pleasant places.
The <i>hakim</i> is full of learning; but he is in no way proud. I spoke to
him&mdash;when thou wast talking to the Sahiba&mdash;of a certain dizziness
that lays hold upon the back of my neck in the night, and he said it rose from
excessive heat&mdash;to be cured by cool air. Upon consideration, I marvelled
that I had not thought of such a simple remedy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didst thou tell him of thy Search?&rdquo; said Kim, a little jealously.
He preferred to sway the lama by his own speech&mdash;not through the wiles of
Hurree Babu.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Assuredly. I told him of my dream, and of the manner by which I had
acquired merit by causing thee to be taught wisdom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou didst not say I was a Sahib?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What need? I have told thee many times we be but two souls seeking
escape. He said&mdash;and he is just herein&mdash;that the River of Healing
will break forth even as I dreamed&mdash;at my feet, if need be. Having found
the Way, seest thou, that shall free me from the Wheel, need I trouble to find
a way about the mere fields of earth&mdash;which are illusion? That were
senseless. I have my dreams, night upon night repeated; I have <i>Jâtaka;</i>
and I have thee, Friend of all the World. It was written in thy horoscope that
a Red Bull on a green field&mdash;I have not forgotten&mdash;should bring thee
to honour. Who but I saw that prophecy accomplished? Indeed, I was the
instrument. Thou shalt find me my River, being in return the instrument. The
Search is sure!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He set his ivory-yellow face, serene and untroubled, towards the beckoning
Hills; his shadow shouldering far before him in the dust.

&ldquo;Who goes to the hills goes to his mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They had crossed the Siwaliks and the half-tropical Doon, left Mussoorie behind
them, and headed north along the narrow hill-roads. Day after day they struck
deeper into the huddled mountains, and day after day Kim watched the lama
return to a man&rsquo;s strength. Among the terraces of the Doon he had leaned
on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder, ready to profit by wayside halts. Under the great
ramp to Mussoorie he drew himself together as an old hunter faces a
well-remembered bank, and where he should have sunk exhausted swung his long
draperies about him, drew a deep double-lungful of the diamond air, and walked
as only a hillman can. Kim, plains-bred and plains-fed, sweated and panted
astonished. &ldquo;This is <i>my</i> country,&rdquo; said the lama.
&ldquo;Beside Such-zen, this is flatter than a rice-field&rdquo;; and with
steady, driving strokes from the loins he strode upwards. But it was on the
steep downhill marches, three thousand feet in three hours, that he went
utterly away from Kim, whose back ached with holding back, and whose big toe
was nigh cut off by his grass sandal-string. Through the speckled shadow of the
great deodar-forests; through oak feathered and plumed with ferns; birch, ilex,
rhododendron, and pine, out on to the bare hillsides&rsquo; slippery sunburnt
grass, and back into the woodlands&rsquo; coolth again, till oak gave way to
bamboo and palm of the valley, the lama swung untiring.
</p>

<p>
Glancing back in the twilight at the huge ridges behind him and the faint, thin
line of the road whereby they had come, he would lay out, with a
hillman&rsquo;s generous breadth of vision, fresh marches for the morrow; or,
halting in the neck of some uplifted pass that gave on Spiti and Kulu, would
stretch out his hands yearningly towards the high snows of the horizon. In the
dawns they flared windy-red above stark blue, as Kedarnath and
Badrinath&mdash;kings of that wilderness&mdash;took the first sunlight. All day
long they lay like molten silver under the sun, and at evening put on their
jewels again. At first they breathed temperately upon the travellers, winds
good to meet when one crawled over some gigantic hog&rsquo;s-back; but in a few
days, at a height of nine or ten thousand feet, those breezes bit; and Kim
kindly allowed a village of hillmen to acquire merit by giving him a rough
blanket-coat. The lama was mildly surprised that anyone should object to the
knife-edged breezes which had cut the years off his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These are but the lower hills, <i>chela</i>. There is no cold till we
come to the true Hills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Air and water are good, and the people are devout enough, but the food
is very bad,&rdquo; Kim growled; &ldquo;and we walk as though we were
mad&mdash;or English. It freezes at night, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little, maybe; but only enough to make old bones rejoice in the sun.
We must not always delight in soft beds and rich food.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We might at least keep to the road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim had all a plainsman&rsquo;s affection for the well-trodden track, not six
feet wide, that snaked among the mountains; but the lama, being Tibetan, could
not refrain from short cuts over spurs and the rims of gravel-strewn slopes. As
he explained to his limping disciple, a man bred among mountains can prophesy
the course of a mountain-road, and though low-lying clouds might be a hindrance
to a short-cutting stranger, they made no earthly difference to a thoughtful
man. Thus, after long hours of what would be reckoned very fair mountaineering
in civilized countries, they would pant over a saddle-back, sidle past a few
landslips, and drop through forest at an angle of forty-five onto the road
again. Along their track lay the villages of the hillfolk&mdash;mud and earth
huts, timbers now and then rudely carved with an axe&mdash;clinging like
swallows&rsquo; nests against the steeps, huddled on tiny flats half-way down a
three-thousand-foot glissade; jammed into a corner between cliffs that
funnelled and focused every wandering blast; or, for the sake of summer
pasture, cowering down on a neck that in winter would be ten feet deep in snow.
And the people&mdash;the sallow, greasy, duffle-clad people, with short bare
legs and faces almost Esquimaux&mdash;would flock out and adore. The
Plains&mdash;kindly and gentle&mdash;had treated the lama as a holy man among
holy men. But the Hills worshipped him as one in the confidence of all their
devils. Theirs was an almost obliterated Buddhism, overlaid with a
nature-worship fantastic as their own landscapes, elaborate as the terracing of
their tiny fields; but they recognized the big hat, the clicking rosary, and
the rare Chinese texts for great authority; and they respected the man beneath
the hat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We saw thee come down over the black Breasts of Eua,&rdquo; said a Betah
who gave them cheese, sour milk, and stone-hard bread one evening. &ldquo;We do
not use that often&mdash;except when calving cows stray in summer. There is a
sudden wind among those stones that casts men down on the stillest day. But
what should such folk care for the Devil of Eua!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then did Kim, aching in every fibre, dizzy with looking down, footsore with
cramping desperate toes into inadequate crannies, take joy in the day&rsquo;s
march&mdash;such joy as a boy of St Xavier&rsquo;s who had won the quarter-mile
on the flat might take in the praises of his friends. The hills sweated the
<i>ghi</i> and sugar suet off his bones; the dry air, taken sobbingly at the
head of cruel passes, firmed and built out his upper ribs; and the tilted
levels put new hard muscles into calf and thigh.
</p>

<p>
They meditated often on the Wheel of Life&mdash;the more so since, as the lama
said, they were freed from its visible temptations. Except the grey eagle and
an occasional far-seen bear grubbing and rooting on the hillside; a vision of a
furious painted leopard met at dawn in a still valley devouring a goat; and now
and again a bright-coloured bird, they were alone with the winds and the grass
singing under the wind. The women of the smoky huts over whose roofs the two
walked as they descended the mountains, were unlovely and unclean, wives of
many husbands, and afflicted with goitre. The men were woodcutters when they
were not farmers&mdash;meek, and of an incredible simplicity. But that suitable
discourse might not fail, Fate sent them, overtaking and overtaken upon the
road, the courteous Dacca physician, who paid for his food in ointments good
for goitre and counsels that restore peace between men and women. He seemed to
know these hills as well as he knew the hill dialects, and gave the lama the
lie of the land towards Ladakh and Tibet. He said they could return to the
Plains at any moment. Meantime, for such as loved mountains, yonder road might
amuse. This was not all revealed in a breath, but at evening encounters on the
stone threshing-floors, when, patients disposed of, the doctor would smoke and
the lama snuff, while Kim watched the wee cows grazing on the housetops, or
threw his soul after his eyes across the deep blue gulfs between range and
range. And there were talks apart in the dark woods, when the doctor would seek
herbs, and Kim, as budding physician, must accompany him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, Mister O&rsquo;Hara, I do not know what the deuce-an&rsquo; all
I shall do when I find our sporting friends; but if you will kindly keep within
sight of my umbrella, which is fine fixed point for cadastral survey, I shall
feel much better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim looked out across the jungle of peaks. &ldquo;This is not my country,
<i>hakim</i>. Easier, I think, to find one louse in a bear-skin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah, thatt is my strong points. There is no hurry for Hurree. They were
at Leh not so long ago. They said they had come down from the Karakorum with
their heads and horns and all. I am onlee afraid they will have sent back all
their letters and compromising things from Leh into Russian territoree. Of
course they will walk away as far to the East as possible&mdash;just to show
that they were never among the Western States. You do not know the
Hills?&rdquo; He scratched with a twig on the earth. &ldquo;Look! They should
have come in by Srinagar or Abbottabad. <i>Thatt</i> is their short
road&mdash;down the river by Bunji and Astor. But they have made mischief in
the West. So&rdquo;&mdash;he drew a furrow from left to right&mdash;&ldquo;they
march and they march away East to Leh (ah! it is cold there), and down the
Indus to Hanlé (I know that road), and then down, you see, to Bushahr and Chini
valley. That is ascertained by process of elimination, and also by asking
questions from people that I cure so well. Our friends have been a long time
playing about and producing impressions. So they are well known from far off.
You will see me catch them somewhere in Chini valley. Please keep your eye on
the umbrella.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It nodded like a wind-blown harebell down the valleys and round the mountain
sides, and in due time the lama and Kim, who steered by compass, would overhaul
it, vending ointments and powders at eventide. &ldquo;We came by such and such
a way!&rdquo; The lama would throw a careless finger backward at the ridges,
and the umbrella would expend itself in compliments.
</p>

<p>
They crossed a snowy pass in cold moonlight, when the lama, mildly chaffing
Kim, went through up to his knees, like a Bactrian camel&mdash;the snow-bred,
shag-haired sort that came into the Kashmir Serai. They dipped across beds of
light snow and snow-powdered shale, where they took refuge from a gale in a
camp of Tibetans hurrying down tiny sheep, each laden with a bag of borax. They
came out upon grassy shoulders still snow-speckled, and through forest, to
grass anew. For all their marchings, Kedarnath and Badrinath were not
impressed; and it was only after days of travel that Kim, uplifted upon some
insignificant ten-thousand-foot hummock, could see that a shoulder-knot or horn
of the two great lords had&mdash;ever so slightly&mdash;changed outline.
</p>

<p>
At last they entered a world within a world&mdash;a valley of leagues where the
high hills were fashioned of a mere rubble and refuse from off the knees of the
mountains. Here one day&rsquo;s march carried them no farther, it seemed, than
a dreamer&rsquo;s clogged pace bears him in a nightmare. They skirted a
shoulder painfully for hours, and, behold, it was but an outlying boss in an
outlying buttress of the main pile! A rounded meadow revealed itself, when they
had reached it, for a vast tableland running far into the valley. Three days
later, it was a dim fold in the earth to southward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely the Gods live here!&rdquo; said Kim, beaten down by the silence
and the appalling sweep and dispersal of the cloud-shadows after rain.
&ldquo;This is no place for men!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Long and long ago,&rdquo; said the lama, as to himself, &ldquo;it was
asked of the Lord whether the world were everlasting. On this the Excellent One
returned no answer ... When I was in Ceylon, a wise Seeker confirmed that from
the gospel which is written in Pali. Certainly, since we know the way to
Freedom, the question were unprofitable, but&mdash;look, and know illusion,
<i>chela!</i> These&mdash;are the true Hills! They are like my hills by
Suchzen. Never were such hills!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Above them, still enormously above them, earth towered away towards the
snow-line, where from east to west across hundreds of miles, ruled as with a
ruler, the last of the bold birches stopped. Above that, in scarps and blocks
upheaved, the rocks strove to fight their heads above the white smother. Above
these again, changeless since the world&rsquo;s beginning, but changing to
every mood of sun and cloud, lay out the eternal snow. They could see blots and
blurs on its face where storm and wandering wullie-wa got up to dance. Below
them, as they stood, the forest slid away in a sheet of blue-green for mile
upon mile; below the forest was a village in its sprinkle of terraced fields
and steep grazing-grounds. Below the village they knew, though a thunderstorm
worried and growled there for the moment, a pitch of twelve or fifteen hundred
feet gave to the moist valley where the streams gather that are the mothers of
young Sutluj.
</p>

<p>
As usual, the lama had led Kim by cow-track and by-road, far from the main
route along which Hurree Babu, that &ldquo;fearful man&rdquo;, had bucketed
three days before through a storm to which nine Englishmen out of ten would
have given full right of way. Hurree was no game-shot&mdash;the snick of a
trigger made him change colour&mdash;but, as he himself would have said, he was
&ldquo;fairly effeecient stalker&rdquo;, and he had raked the huge valley with
a pair of cheap binoculars to some purpose. Moreover, the white of worn canvas
tents against green carries far. Hurree Babu had seen all he wanted to see when
he sat on the threshing-floor of Ziglaur, twenty miles away as the eagle flies,
and forty by road&mdash;that is to say, two small dots which one day were just
below the snow-line, and the next had moved downward perhaps six inches on the
hillside. Once cleaned out and set to the work, his fat bare legs could cover a
surprising amount of ground, and this was the reason why, while Kim and the
lama lay in a leaky hut at Ziglaur till the storm should be over-past, an oily,
wet, but always smiling Bengali, talking the best of English with the vilest of
phrases, was ingratiating himself with two sodden and rather rheumatic
foreigners. He had arrived, revolving many wild schemes, on the heels of a
thunderstorm which had split a pine over against their camp, and so convinced a
dozen or two forcibly impressed baggage-coolies the day was inauspicious for
farther travel that with one accord they had thrown down their loads and
jibbed. They were subjects of a Hill Rajah who farmed out their services, as is
the custom, for his private gain; and, to add to their personal distresses, the
strange Sahibs had already threatened them with rifles. The most of them knew
rifles and Sahibs of old: they were trackers and <i>shikarris</i> of the
Northern valleys, keen after bear and wild goat; but they had never been thus
treated in their lives. So the forest took them to her bosom, and, for all
oaths and clamour, refused to restore. There was no need to feign madness
or&mdash;the Babu had thought of another means of securing a welcome. He wrung
out his wet clothes, slipped on his patent-leather shoes, opened the
blue-and-white umbrella, and with mincing gait and a heart beating against his
tonsils appeared as &ldquo;agent for His Royal Highness, the Rajah of Rampur,
gentlemen. What can I do for you, please?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The gentlemen were delighted. One was visibly French, the other Russian, but
they spoke English not much inferior to the Babu&rsquo;s. They begged his kind
offices. Their native servants had gone sick at Leh. They had hurried on
because they were anxious to bring the spoils of the chase to Simla ere the
skins grew moth-eaten. They bore a general letter of introduction (the Babu
salaamed to it orientally) to all Government officials. No, they had not met
any other shooting-parties <i>en route</i>. They did for themselves. They had
plenty of supplies. They only wished to push on as soon as might be. At this he
waylaid a cowering hillman among the trees, and after three minutes&rsquo; talk
and a little silver (one cannot be economical upon State service, though
Hurree&rsquo;s heart bled at the waste) the eleven coolies and the three
hangers-on reappeared. At least the Babu would be a witness to their
oppression.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My royal master, he will be much annoyed, but these people are onlee
common people and grossly ignorant. If your honours will kindly overlook
unfortunate affair, I shall be much pleased. In a little while rain will stop
and we can then proceed. You have been shooting, eh? That is fine
performance!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He skipped nimbly from one <i>kilta</i> to the next, making pretence to adjust
each conical basket. The Englishman is not, as a rule, familiar with the
Asiatic, but he would not strike across the wrist a kindly Babu who had
accidentally upset a <i>kilta</i> with a red oilskin top. On the other hand, he
would not press drink upon a Babu were he never so friendly, nor would he
invite him to meat. The strangers did all these things, and asked many
questions&mdash;about women mostly&mdash;to which Hurree returned gay and
unstudied answers. They gave him a glass of whitish fluid like to gin, and then
more; and in a little time his gravity departed from him. He became thickly
treasonous, and spoke in terms of sweeping indecency of a Government which had
forced upon him a white man&rsquo;s education and neglected to supply him with
a white man&rsquo;s salary. He babbled tales of oppression and wrong till the
tears ran down his cheeks for the miseries of his land. Then he staggered off,
singing love-songs of Lower Bengal, and collapsed upon a wet tree-trunk. Never
was so unfortunate a product of English rule in India more unhappily thrust
upon aliens.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are all just of that pattern,&rdquo; said one sportsman to the
other in French. &ldquo;When we get into India proper thou wilt see. I should
like to visit his Rajah. One might speak the good word there. It is possible
that he has heard of us and wishes to signify his good-will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have not time. We must get into Simla as soon as may be,&rdquo; his
companion replied. &ldquo;For my own part, I wish our reports had been sent
back from Hilás, or even Leh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The English post is better and safer. Remember we are given all
facilities&mdash;and Name of God!&mdash;they give them to us too! Is it
unbelievable stupidity?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is pride&mdash;pride that deserves and will receive
punishment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes! To fight a fellow-Continental in our game is something. There is a
risk attached, but these people&mdash;bah! It is too easy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pride&mdash;all pride, my friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now what the deuce is good of Chandernagore being so close to Calcutta
and all,&rdquo; said Hurree, snoring open-mouthed on the sodden moss, &ldquo;if
I cannot understand their French? They talk so par<i>tic</i>ularly fast! It
would have been much better to cut their beastly throats.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he presented himself again he was racked with a headache&mdash;penitent,
and volubly afraid that in his drunkenness he might have been indiscreet. He
loved the British Government&mdash;it was the source of all prosperity and
honour, and his master at Rampur held the very same opinion. Upon this the men
began to deride him and to quote past words, till step by step, with
deprecating smirks, oily grins, and leers of infinite cunning, the poor Babu
was beaten out of his defences and forced to speak&mdash;truth. When Lurgan was
told the tale later, he mourned aloud that he could not have been in the place
of the stubborn, inattentive coolies, who with grass mats over their heads and
the raindrops puddling in their footprints, waited on the weather. All the
Sahibs of their acquaintance&mdash;rough-clad men joyously returning year after
year to their chosen gullies&mdash;had servants and cooks and orderlies, very
often hillmen. These Sahibs travelled without any retinue. Therefore they were
poor Sahibs, and ignorant; for no Sahib in his senses would follow a
Bengali&rsquo;s advice. But the Bengali, appearing from somewhere, had given
them money, and could make shift with their dialect. Used to comprehensive
ill-treatment from their own colour, they suspected a trap somewhere, and stood
by to run if occasion offered.
</p>

<p>
Then through the new-washed air, steaming with delicious earth-smells, the Babu
led the way down the slopes&mdash;walking ahead of the coolies in pride;
walking behind the foreigners in humility. His thoughts were many and various.
The least of them would have interested his companions beyond words. But he was
an agreeable guide, ever keen to point out the beauties of his royal
master&rsquo;s domain. He peopled the hills with anything thev had a mind to
slay&mdash;thar, ibex, or markhor, and bear by Elisha&rsquo;s allowance. He
discoursed of botany and ethnology with unimpeachable inaccuracy, and his store
of local legends&mdash;he had been a trusted agent of the State for fifteen
years, remember&mdash;was inexhaustible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Decidedly this fellow is an original,&rdquo; said the taller of the two
foreigners. &ldquo;He is like the nightmare of a Viennese courier.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He represents <i>in petto</i> India in transition&mdash;the monstrous
hybridism of East and West,&rdquo; the Russian replied. &ldquo;It is <i>we</i>
who can deal with Orientals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has lost his own country and has not acquired any other. But he has a
most complete hatred of his conquerors. Listen. He confided to me last
night,&rdquo; said the other.
</p>

<p>
Under the striped umbrella Hurree Babu was straining ear and brain to follow
the quick-poured French, and keeping both eyes on a <i>kilta</i> full of maps
and documents&mdash;an extra-large one with a double red oil-skin cover. He did
not wish to steal anything. He only desired to know what to steal, and,
incidentally, how to get away when he had stolen it. He thanked all the Gods of
Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal.
</p>

<p>
On the second day the road rose steeply to a grass spur above the forest; and
it was here, about sunset, that they came across an aged lama&mdash;but they
called him a bonze&mdash;sitting cross-legged above a mysterious chart held
down by stones, which he was explaining to a young man, evidently a neophyte,
of singular, though unwashen, beauty. The striped umbrella had been sighted
half a march away, and Kim had suggested a halt till it came up to them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Hurree Babu, resourceful as Puss-in-Boots. &ldquo;That
is eminent local holy man. Probably subject of my royal master.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is he doing? It is very curious.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is expounding holy picture&mdash;<i>all</i> hand-worked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two men stood bareheaded in the wash of the afternoon sunlight low across
the gold-coloured grass. The sullen coolies, glad of the check, halted and slid
down their loads.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the Frenchman. &ldquo;It is like a picture for the
birth of a religion&mdash;the first teacher and the first disciple. Is he a
Buddhist?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of some debased kind,&rdquo; the other answered. &ldquo;There are no
true Buddhists among the Hills. But look at the folds of the drapery. Look at
his eyes&mdash;how insolent! Why does this make one feel that we are so young a
people?&rdquo; The speaker struck passionately at a tall weed. &ldquo;We have
nowhere left our mark yet. Nowhere! <i>That</i>, do you understand, is what
disquiets me.&rdquo; He scowled at the placid face, and the monumental calm of
the pose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have patience. We shall make your mark together&mdash;we and you young
people. Meantime, draw his picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Babu advanced loftily; his back out of all keeping with his deferential
speech, or his wink towards Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Holy One, these be Sahibs. My medicines cured one of a flux, and I go
into Simla to oversee his recovery. They wish to see thy picture&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To heal the sick is always good. This is the Wheel of Life,&rdquo; said
the lama, &ldquo;the same I showed thee in the hut at Ziglaur when the rain
fell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And to hear thee expound it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama&rsquo;s eyes lighted at the prospect of new listeners. &ldquo;To
expound the Most Excellent Way is good. Have they any knowledge of Hindi, such
as had the Keeper of Images?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little, maybe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hereat, simply as a child engrossed with a new game, the lama threw back his
head and began the full-throated invocation of the Doctor of Divinity ere he
opens the full doctrine. The strangers leaned on their alpenstocks and
listened. Kim, squatting humbly, watched the red sunlight on their faces, and
the blend and parting of their long shadows. They wore un-English leggings and
curious girt-in belts that reminded him hazily of the pictures in a book in St
Xavier&rsquo;s library &lsquo;<i>The Adventures of a Young Naturalist in
Mexico</i>&rsquo; was its name. Yes, they looked very like the wonderful M.
Sumichrast of that tale, and very unlike the &ldquo;highly unscrupulous
folk&rdquo; of Hurree Babu&rsquo;s imagining. The coolies, earth-coloured and
mute, crouched reverently some twenty or thirty yards away, and the Babu, the
slack of his thin gear snapping like a marking-flag in the chill breeze, stood
by with an air of happy proprietorship.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These are the men,&rdquo; Hurree whispered, as the ritual went on and
the two whites followed the grass-blade sweeping from Hell to Heaven and back
again. &ldquo;All their books are in the large <i>kilta</i> with the reddish
top&mdash;books and reports and maps&mdash;and I have seen a King&rsquo;s
letter that either Hilás or Bunár has written. They guard it most carefully.
They have sent nothing back from Hilás or Leh. That is sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is with them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only the <i>beegar</i>-coolies. They have no servants. They are so close
they cook their own food.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait and see. Only if any chance comes to me thou wilt know where to
seek for the papers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This were better in Mahbub Ali&rsquo;s hands than a
Bengali&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Kim scornfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are more ways of getting to a sweetheart than butting down a
wall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See here the Hell appointed for avarice and greed. Flanked upon the one
side by Desire and on the other by Weariness.&rdquo; The lama warmed to his
work, and one of the strangers sketched him in the quick-fading light.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; the man said at last brusquely. &ldquo;I cannot
understand him, but I want that picture. He is a better artist than I. Ask him
if he will sell it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says &lsquo;No, sar,&rsquo;&rdquo; the Babu replied. The lama, of
course, would no more have parted with his chart to a casual wayfarer than an
archbishop would pawn the holy vessels of his cathedral. All Tibet is full of
cheap reproductions of the Wheel; but the lama was an artist, as well as a
wealthy Abbot in his own place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps in three days, or four, or ten, if I perceive that the Sahib is
a Seeker and of good understanding, I may myself draw him another. But
<i>this</i> was used for the initiation of a novice. Tell him so,
<i>hakim</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wishes it now&mdash;for money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama shook his head slowly and began to fold up the Wheel. The Russian, on
his side, saw no more than an unclean old man haggling over a dirty piece of
paper. He drew out a handful of rupees, and snatched half-jestingly at the
chart, which tore in the lama&rsquo;s grip. A low murmur of horror went up from
the coolies&mdash;some of whom were Spiti men and, by their lights, good
Buddhists. The lama rose at the insult; his hand went to the heavy iron pencase
that is the priest&rsquo;s weapon, and the Babu danced in agony.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you see&mdash;you see why I wanted witnesses. They are highly
unscrupulous people. Oh, sar! sar! You must <i>not</i> hit holyman!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Chela!</i> He has defiled the Written Word!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was too late. Before Kim could ward him off, the Russian struck the old man
full on the face. Next instant he was rolling over and over downhill with Kim
at his throat. The blow had waked every unknown Irish devil in the boy&rsquo;s
blood, and the sudden fall of his enemy did the rest. The lama dropped to his
knees, half-stunned; the coolies under their loads fled up the hill as fast as
plainsmen run aross the level. They had seen sacrilege unspeakable, and it
behoved them to get away before the Gods and devils of the hills took
vengeance. The Frenchman ran towards the lama, fumbling at his revolver with
some notion of making him a hostage for his companion. A shower of cutting
stones&mdash;hillmen are very straight shots&mdash;drove him away, and a coolie
from Ao-chung snatched the lama into the stampede. All came about as swiftly as
the sudden mountain-darkness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They have taken the baggage and all the guns,&rdquo; yelled the
Frenchman, firing blindly into the twilight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, sar! All right! Don&rsquo;t shoot. I go to rescue,&rdquo; and
Hurree, pounding down the slope, cast himself bodily upon the delighted and
astonished Kim, who was banging his breathless foe&rsquo;s head against a
boulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go back to the coolies,&rdquo; whispered the Babu in his ear.
&ldquo;They have the baggage. The papers are in the <i>kilta</i> with the red
top, but look through all. Take their papers, and specially the <i>murasla</i>
(King&rsquo;s letter). Go! The other man comes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim tore uphill. A revolver-bullet rang on a rock by his side, and he cowered
partridge-wise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you shoot,&rdquo; shouted Hurree, &ldquo;they will descend and
annihilate us. I have rescued the gentleman, sar. This is par<i>tic</i>ularly
dangerous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; Kim was thinking hard in English. &ldquo;This is
dam&rsquo;-tight place, but <i>I</i> think it is self-defence.&rdquo; He felt
in his bosom for Mahbub&rsquo;s gift, and uncertainly&mdash;save for a few
practice shots in the Bikanir desert, he had never used the little
gun&mdash;pulled the trigger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did I say, sar!&rdquo; The Babu seemed to be in tears. &ldquo;Come
down here and assist to resuscitate. We are all up a tree, I tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The shots ceased. There was a sound of stumbling feet, and Kim hurried upward
through the gloom, swearing like a cat&mdash;or a country-bred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did they wound thee, <i>chela?</i>&rdquo; called the lama above him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. And thou?&rdquo; He dived into a clump of stunted firs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Unhurt. Come away. We go with these folk to
Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But not before we have done justice,&rdquo; a voice cried. &ldquo;I have
got the Sahibs&rsquo; guns&mdash;all four. Let us go down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He struck the Holy One&mdash;we saw it! Our cattle will be
barren&mdash;our wives will cease to bear! The snows will slide upon us as we
go home... Atop of all other oppression too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little fir-clump filled with clamouring coolies&mdash;panic-stricken, and
in their terror capable of anything. The man from Ao-chung clicked the
breech-bolt of his gun impatiently, and made as to go downhill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait a little, Holy One; they cannot go far. Wait till I return,&rdquo;
said he.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is this person who has suffered wrong,&rdquo; said the lama, his hand
over his brow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For that very reason,&rdquo; was the reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If this person overlooks it, your hands are clean. Moreover, ye acquire
merit by obedience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait, and we will all go to Shamlegh together,&rdquo; the man insisted.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, for just so long as it needs to stuff a cartridge into a
breech-loader, the lama hesitated. Then he rose to his feet, and laid a finger
on the man&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hast thou heard? <i>I</i> say there shall be no killing&mdash;I who was
Abbot of Such-zen. Is it any lust of thine to be re-born as a rat, or a snake
under the eaves&mdash;a worm in the belly of the most mean beast? Is it thy
wish to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man from Ao-chung fell to his knees, for the voice boomed like a Tibetan
devil-gong.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ai! ai!&rdquo; cried the Spiti men. &ldquo;Do not curse us&mdash;do not
curse him. It was but his zeal, Holy One! ... Put down the rifle, fool!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anger on anger! Evil on evil! There will be no killing. Let the
priest-beaters go in bondage to their own acts. Just and sure is the Wheel,
swerving not a hair! They will be born many times&mdash;in torment.&rdquo; His
head drooped, and he leaned heavily on Kim&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have come near to great evil, <i>chela</i>,&rdquo; he whispered in
that dead hush under the pines. &ldquo;I was tempted to loose the bullet; and
truly, in Tibet there would have been a heavy and a slow death for them ... He
struck me across the face ... upon the flesh ...&rdquo; He slid to the ground,
breathing heavily, and Kim could hear the over-driven heart bump and check.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have they hurt him to the death?&rdquo; said the Ao-chung man, while the
others stood mute.
</p>

<p>
Kim knelt over the body in deadly fear. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he cried
passionately, &ldquo;this is only a weakness.&rdquo; Then he remembered that he
was a white man, with a white man&rsquo;s camp-fittings at his service.
&ldquo;Open the <i>kiltas!</i> The Sahibs may have a medicine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oho! Then I know it,&rdquo; said the Ao-chung man with a laugh.
&ldquo;Not for five years was I Yankling Sahib&rsquo;s <i>shikarri</i> without
knowing that medicine. I too have tasted it. Behold!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He drew from his breast a bottle of cheap whisky&mdash;such as is sold to
explorers at Leh&mdash;and cleverly forced a little between the lama&rsquo;s
teeth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I did when Yankling Sahib twisted his foot beyond Astor. Aha! I have
already looked into their baskets&mdash;but we will make fair division at
Shamlegh. Give him a little more. It is good medicine. Feel! His heart goes
better now. Lay his head down and rub a little on the chest. If he had waited
quietly while I accounted for the Sahibs this would never have come. But
perhaps the Sahibs may chase us here. Then it would not be wrong to shoot them
with their own guns, heh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One is paid, I think, already,&rdquo; said Kim between his teeth.
&ldquo;I kicked him in the groin as we went downhill. Would I had killed
him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is well to be brave when one does not live in Rampur,&rdquo; said one
whose hut lay within a few miles of the Rajah&rsquo;s rickety palace. &ldquo;If
we get a bad name among the Sahibs, none will employ us as <i>shikarris</i> any
more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but these are not Angrezi Sahibs&mdash;not merry-minded men like
Fostum Sahib or Yankling Sahib. They are foreigners&mdash;they cannot speak
Angrezi as do Sahibs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here the lama coughed and sat up, groping for the rosary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There shall be no killing,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Just is the Wheel!
Evil on evil&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, Holy One. We are all here.&rdquo; The Ao-chung man timidly patted
his feet. &ldquo;Except by thy order, no one shall be slain. Rest awhile. We
will make a little camp here, and later, as the moon rises, we go to
Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After a blow,&rdquo; said a Spiti man sententiously, &ldquo;it is best
to sleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is, as it were, a dizziness at the back of my neck, and a pinching
in it. Let me lay my head on thy lap, <i>chela</i>. I am an old man, but not
free from passion ... We must think of the Cause of Things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give him a blanket. We dare not light a fire lest the Sahibs see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better get away to Shamlegh. None will follow us to Shamlegh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was the nervous Rampur man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have been Fostum Sahib&rsquo;s <i>shikarri</i>, and I am Yankling
Sahib&rsquo;s <i>shikarri</i>. I should have been with Yankling Sahib now but
for this cursed <i>beegar</i> (the <i>corvée</i>). Let two men watch below with
the guns lest the Sahibs do more foolishness. <i>I</i> shall not leave this
Holy One.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They sat down a little apart from the lama, and, after listening awhile, passed
round a water-pipe whose receiver was an old Day and Martin blacking-bottle.
The glow of the red charcoal as it went from hand to hand lit up the narrow,
blinking eyes, the high Chinese cheek-bones, and the bull-throats that melted
away into the dark duffle folds round the shoulders. They looked like kobolds
from some magic mine&mdash;gnomes of the hills in conclave. And while they
talked, the voices of the snow-waters round them diminished one by one as the
night-frost choked and clogged the runnels.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How he stood up against us!&rdquo; said a Spiti man admiring. &ldquo;I
remember an old ibex, out Ladakh-way, that Dupont Sahib missed on a
shoulder-shot, seven seasons back, standing up just like him. Dupont Sahib was
a good <i>shikarri</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not as good as Yankling Sahib.&rdquo; The Ao-chung man took a pull at
the whisky-bottle and passed it over. &ldquo;Now hear me&mdash;unless any other
man thinks he knows more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The challenge was not taken up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We go to Shamlegh when the moon rises. There we will fairly divide the
baggage between us. I am content with this new little rifle and all its
cartridges.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are the bears only bad on thy holding? said a mate, sucking at the pipe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; but musk-pods are worth six rupees apiece now, and thy women can
have the canvas of the tents and some of the cooking-gear. We will do all that
at Shamlegh before dawn. Then we all go our ways, remembering that we have
never seen or taken service with these Sahibs, who may, indeed, say that we
have stolen their baggage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is well for thee, but what will our Rajah say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is to tell him? Those Sahibs, who cannot speak our talk, or the
Babu, who for his own ends gave us money? Will <i>he</i> lead an army against
us? What evidence will remain? That we do not need we shall throw on
Shamlegh-midden, where no man has yet set foot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is at Shamlegh this summer?&rdquo; The place was only a grazing
centre of three or four huts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Woman of Shamlegh. <i>She</i> has no love for Sahibs, as we know.
The others can be pleased with little presents; and here is enough for us
all.&rdquo; He patted the fat sides of the nearest basket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have said they are not true Sahibs. All their skins and heads were
bought in the bazar at Leh. <i>I</i> know the marks. I showed them to ye last
march.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True. They were all bought skins and heads. Some had even the moth in
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was a shrewd argument, and the Ao-chung man knew his fellows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If the worst comes to the worst, I shall tell Yankling Sahib, who is a
man of a merry mind, and he will laugh. We are not doing any wrong to any
Sahibs whom we know. <i>They</i> are priest-beaters. They frightened us. We
fled! Who knows where we dropped the baggage? Do ye think Yankling Sahib will
permit down-country police to wander all over the hills, disturbing his game?
It is a far cry from Simla to Chini, and farther from Shamlegh to
Shamlegh-midden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So be it, but I carry the big <i>kilta</i>. The basket with the red top
that the Sahibs pack themselves every morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thus it is proved,&rdquo; said the Shamlegh man adroitly, &ldquo;that
they are Sahibs of no account. Who ever heard of Fostum Sahib, or Yankling
Sahib, or even the little Peel Sahib that sits up of nights to shoot
serow&mdash;I say, who, ever heard of these Sahibs coming into the hills
without a down-country cook, and a bearer, and&mdash;and all manner of
well-paid, high-handed and oppressive folk in their tail? How can they make
trouble? What of the <i>kilta?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, but that it is full of the Written Word&mdash;books and papers
in which they wrote, and strange instruments, as of worship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shamlegh-midden will take them all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True! But how if we insult the Sahibs&rsquo; Gods thereby! I do not like
to handle the Written Word in that fashion. And their brass idols are beyond my
comprehension. It is no plunder for simple hill-folk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The old man still sleeps. Hst! We will ask his <i>chela</i>.&rdquo; The
Ao-chung man refreshed himself, and swelled with pride of leadership.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have here,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;a <i>kilta</i> whose nature we
do not know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; said Kim cautiously. The lama drew breath in natural,
easy sleep, and Kim had been thinking of Hurree&rsquo;s last words. As a player
of the Great Game, he was disposed just then to reverence the Babu. &ldquo;It
is a <i>kilta</i> with a red top full of very wonderful things, not to be
handled by fools.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said it; I said it,&rdquo; cried the bearer of that burden.
&ldquo;Thinkest thou it will betray us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not if it be given to me. I can draw out its magic. Otherwise it will do
great harm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A priest always takes his share.&rdquo; Whisky was demoralizing the
Ao-chung man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is no matter to me.&rdquo; Kim answered, with the craft of his
mother-country. &ldquo;Share it among you, and see what comes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not I. I was only jesting. Give the order. There is more than enough for
us all. We go our way from Shamlegh in the dawn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They arranged and re-arranged their artless little plans for another hour,
while Kim shivered with cold and pride. The humour of the situation tickled the
Irish and the Oriental in his soul. Here were the emissaries of the dread Power
of the North, very possibly as great in their own land as Mahbub or Colonel
Creighton, suddenly smitten helpless. One of them, he privately knew, would be
lame for a time. They had made promises to Kings. Tonight they lay out
somewhere below him, chartless, foodless, tentless, gunless&mdash;except for
Hurree Babu, guideless. And this collapse of their Great Game (Kim wondered to
whom they would report it), this panicky bolt into the night, had come about
through no craft of Hurree&rsquo;s or contrivance of Kim&rsquo;s, but simply,
beautifully, and inevitably as the capture of Mahbub&rsquo;s
<i>faquir</i>-friends by the zealous young policeman at Umballa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are there&mdash;with nothing; and, by Jove, it is cold! I am here
with all their things. Oh, they will be angry! I am sorry for Hurree
Babu.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim might have saved his pity, for though at that moment the Bengali suffered
acutely in the flesh, his soul was puffed and lofty. A mile down the hill, on
the edge of the pine-forest, two half-frozen men&mdash;one powerfully sick at
intervals&mdash;were varying mutual recriminations with the most poignant abuse
of the Babu, who seemed distraught with terror. They demanded a plan of action.
He explained that they were very lucky to be alive; that their coolies, if not
then stalking them, had passed beyond recall; that the Rajah, his master, was
ninety miles away, and, so far from lending them money and a retinue for the
Simla journey, would surely cast them into prison if he heard that they had hit
a priest. He enlarged on this sin and its consequences till they bade him
change the subject. Their one hope, said he, was unostentatious flight from
village to village till they reached civilization; and, for the hundredth time
dissolved in tears, he demanded of the high stars why the Sahibs &ldquo;had
beaten holy man&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Ten steps would have taken Hurree into the creaking gloom utterly beyond their
reach&mdash;to the shelter and food of the nearest village, where glib-tongued
doctors were scarce. But he preferred to endure cold, belly-pinch, bad words,
and occasional blows in the company of his honoured employers. Crouched against
a tree-trunk, he sniffed dolefully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And have you thought,&rdquo; said the uninjured man hotly, &ldquo;what
sort of spectacle we shall present wandering through these hills among these
aborigines?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hurree Babu had thought of little else for some hours, but the remark was not
to his address.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We cannot wander! I can hardly walk,&rdquo; groaned Kim&rsquo;s victim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps the holy man will be merciful in loving-kindness, sar,
otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I promise myself a peculiar pleasure in emptying my revolver into that
young bonze when next we meet,&rdquo; was the unchristian answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Revolvers! Vengeance! Bonzes!&rdquo; Hurree crouched lower. The war was
breaking out afresh. &ldquo;Have you no consideration for our loss? The
baggage! The baggage!&rdquo; He could hear the speaker literally dancing on the
grass. &ldquo;Everything we bore! Everything we have secured! Our gains! Eight
months&rsquo; work! Do you know what that means? &lsquo;Decidedly it is we who
can deal with Orientals!&rsquo; Oh, you have done well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They fell to it in several tongues, and Hurree smiled. Kim was with the
<i>kiltas</i>, and in the <i>kiltas</i> lay eight months of good diplomacy.
There was no means of communicating with the boy, but he could be trusted. For
the rest, Hurree could so stage-manage the journey through the hills that
Hilás, Bunár, and four hundred miles of hill-roads should tell the tale for a
generation. Men who cannot control their own coolies are little respected in
the Hills, and the hillman has a very keen sense of humour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I had done it myself,&rdquo; thought Hurree, &ldquo;it would not have
been better; and, by Jove, now I think of it, of course I arranged it myself.
How quick I have been! Just when I ran downhill I thought it! Thee outrage was
accidental, but onlee me could have worked it&mdash;ah&mdash;for all it was
dam&rsquo;-well worth. Consider the moral effect upon these ignorant peoples!
No treaties&mdash;no papers&mdash;no written documents at all&mdash;and
<i>me</i> to interpret for them. How I shall laugh with the Colonel! I wish I
had their papers also: but you cannot occupy two places in space
simultaneously. Thatt is axiomatic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At moonrise the cautious coolies got under way. The lama, refreshed by his
sleep and the spirit, needed no more than Kim&rsquo;s shoulder to bear him
along&mdash;a silent, swift-striding man. They held the shale-sprinkled grass
for an hour, swept round the shoulder of an immortal cliff, and climbed into a
new country entirely blocked off from all sight of Chini valley. A huge
pasture-ground ran up fan-shaped to the living snow. At its base was perhaps
half an acre of flat land, on which stood a few soil and timber huts. Behind
them&mdash;for, hill-fashion, they were perched on the edge of all
things&mdash;the ground fell sheer two thousand feet to Shamlegh-midden, where
never yet man has set foot.
</p>

<p>
The men made no motion to divide the plunder till they had seen the lama bedded
down in the best room of the place, with Kim shampooing his feet,
Mohammedan-fashion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We will send food,&rdquo; said the Ao-chung man, &ldquo;and the
red-topped <i>kilta</i>. By dawn there will be none to give evidence, one way
or the other. If anything is not needed in the <i>kilta</i>&mdash;see
here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He pointed through the window&mdash;opening into space that was filled with
moonlight reflected from the snow&mdash;and threw out an empty whisky-bottle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No need to listen for the fall. This is the world&rsquo;s end,&rdquo; he
said, and went out. The lama looked forth, a hand on either sill, with eyes
that shone like yellow opals. From the enormous pit before him white peaks
lifted themselves yearning to the moonlight. The rest was as the darkness of
interstellar space.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;are indeed my Hills. Thus should a
man abide, perched above the world, separated from delights, considering vast
matters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; if he has a <i>chela</i> to prepare tea for him, and to fold a
blanket for his head, and to chase out calving cows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A smoky lamp burned in a niche, but the full moonlight beat it down; and by the
mixed light, stooping above the food-bag and cups, Kim moved like a tall ghost.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ai! But now I have let the blood cool, my head still beats and drums,
and there is a cord round the back of my neck.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No wonder. It was a strong blow. May he who dealt it&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But for my own passions there would have been no evil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What evil? Thou hast saved the Sahibs from the death they deserved a
hundred times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The lesson is not well learnt, <i>chela</i>.&rdquo; The lama came to
rest on a folded blanket, as Kim went forward with his evening routine.
&ldquo;The blow was but a shadow upon a shadow. Evil in itself&mdash;my legs
weary apace these latter days!&mdash;it met evil in me: anger, rage, and a lust
to return evil. These wrought in my blood, woke tumult in my stomach, and
dazzled my ears.&rdquo; Here he drank scalding black-tea ceremonially, taking
the hot cup from Kim&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Had I been passionless, the evil blow
would have done only bodily evil&mdash;a scar, or a bruise&mdash;which is
illusion. But my mind was <i>not</i> abstracted, for rushed in straightway a
lust to let the Spiti men kill. In fighting that lust, my soul was torn and
wrenched beyond a thousand blows. Not till I had repeated the Blessings&rdquo;
(he meant the Buddhist Beatitudes) &ldquo;did I achieve calm. But the evil
planted in me by that moment&rsquo;s carelessness works out to its end. Just is
the Wheel, swerving not a hair! Learn the lesson, <i>chela</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is too high for me,&rdquo; Kim muttered. &ldquo;I am still all
shaken. I am glad I hurt the man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I felt that, sleeping upon thy knees, in the wood below. It disquieted
me in my dreams&mdash;the evil in thy soul working through to mine. Yet on the
other hand&rdquo;&mdash;he loosed his rosary&mdash;&ldquo;I have acquired merit
by saving two lives&mdash;the lives of those that wronged me. Now I must see
into the Cause of Things. The boat of my soul staggers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sleep, and be strong. That is wisest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I meditate. There is a need greater than thou knowest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Till the dawn, hour after hour, as the moonlight paled on the high peaks, and
that which had been belted blackness on the sides of the far hills showed as
tender green forest, the lama stared fixedly at the wall. From time to time he
groaned. Outside the barred door, where discomfited kine came to ask for their
old stable, Shamlegh and the coolies gave itself up to plunder and riotous
living. The Ao-chung man was their leader, and once they had opened the
Sahibs&rsquo; tinned foods and found that they were very good they dared not
turn back. Shamlegh kitchen-midden took the dunnage.
</p>

<p>
When Kim, after a night of bad dreams, stole forth to brush his teeth in the
morning chill, a fair-coloured woman with turquoise-studded headgear drew him
aside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The others have gone. They left thee this <i>kilta</i> as the promise
was. I do not love Sahibs, but thou wilt make us a charm in return for it. We
do not wish little Shamlegh to get a bad name on account of the&mdash;accident.
I am the Woman of Shamlegh.&rdquo; She looked him over with bold, bright eyes,
unlike the usual furtive glance of hillwomen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Assuredly. But it must be done in secret.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She raised the heavy <i>kilta</i> like a toy and slung it into her own hut.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out and bar the door! Let none come near till it is finished,&rdquo;
said Kim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But afterwards&mdash;we may talk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim tilted the <i>kilta</i> on the floor&mdash;a cascade of Survey-instruments,
books, diaries, letters, maps, and queerly scented native correspondence. At
the very bottom was an embroidered bag covering a sealed, gilded, and
illuminated document such as one King sends to another. Kim caught his breath
with delight, and reviewed the situation from a Sahib&rsquo;s point of view.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The books I do not want. Besides, they are logarithms&mdash;Survey, I
suppose.&rdquo; He laid them aside. &ldquo;The letters I do not understand, but
Colonel Creighton will. They must all be kept. The maps&mdash;they draw better
maps than me&mdash;of course. All the native letters&mdash;oho!&mdash;and
particularly the <i>murasla</i>.&rdquo; He sniffed the embroidered bag.
&ldquo;That must be from Hilás or Bunár, and Hurree Babu spoke truth. By Jove!
It is a fine haul. I wish Hurree could know ... The rest must go out of the
window.&rdquo; He fingered a superb prismatic compass and the shiny top of a
theodolite. But after all, a Sahib cannot very well steal, and the things might
be inconvenient evidence later. He sorted out every scrap of manuscript, every
map, and the native letters. They made one softish slab. The three locked
ferril-backed books, with five worn pocket-books, he put aside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The letters and the <i>murasla</i> I must carry inside my coat and under
my belt, and the hand-written books I must put into the food-bag. It will be
very heavy. No. I do not think there is anything more. If there is, the coolies
have thrown it down the <i>khud</i>, so <i>thatt</i> is all right. Now you go
too.&rdquo; He repacked the <i>kilta</i> with all he meant to lose, and hove it
up on to the windowsill. A thousand feet below lay a long, lazy,
round-shouldered bank of mist, as yet untouched by the morning sun. A thousand
feet below that was a hundred-year-old pine-forest. He could see the green tops
looking like a bed of moss when a wind-eddy thinned the cloud.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No! I don&rsquo;t think any one will go after <i>you!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The wheeling basket vomited its contents as it dropped. The theodolite hit a
jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell; the books, inkstands,
paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed for a few seconds like a swarm of
bees. Then they vanished; and, though Kim, hanging half out of the window,
strained his young ears, never a sound came up from the gulf.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Five hundred&mdash;a thousand rupees could not buy them,&rdquo; he
thought sorrowfully. &ldquo;It was verree wasteful, but I have all their other
stuff&mdash;everything they did&mdash;I hope. Now how the deuce am I to tell
Hurree Babu, and <i>whatt</i> the deuce am I to do? And my old man is sick. I
must tie up the letters in oilskin. That is something to do first&mdash;else
they will get all sweated ... And I am all alone!&rdquo; He bound them into a
neat packet, swedging down the stiff, sticky oilskin at the comers, for his
roving life had made him as methodical as an old hunter in matters of the road.
Then with double care he packed away the books at the bottom of the food-bag.
</p>

<p>
The woman rapped at the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But thou hast made no charm,&rdquo; she said, looking about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no need.&rdquo; Kim had completely overlooked the necessity for
a little patter-talk. The woman laughed at his confusion irreverently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None&mdash;for thee. Thou canst cast a spell by the mere winking of an
eye. But think of us poor people when thou art gone. They were all too drunk
last night to hear a woman. Thou art not drunk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am a priest.&rdquo; Kim had recovered himself, and, the woman being
aught but unlovely, thought best to stand on his office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I warned them that the Sahibs will be angry and will make an inquisition
and a report to the Rajah. There is also the Babu with them. Clerks have long
tongues.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that all thy trouble?&rdquo; The plan rose fully formed in
Kim&rsquo;s mind, and he smiled ravishingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; quoth the woman, putting out a hard brown hand all
covered with turquoises set in silver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can finish that in a breath,&rdquo; he went on quickly. &ldquo;The
Babu is the very <i>hakim</i> (thou hast heard of him?) who was wandering among
the hills by Ziglaur. I know him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He will tell for the sake of a reward. Sahibs cannot distinguish one
hillman from another, but Babus have eyes for men&mdash;and women.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Carry a word to him from me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing I would not do for thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He accepted the compliment calmly, as men must in lands where women make the
love, tore a leaf from a note-book, and with a patent indelible pencil wrote in
gross Shikast&mdash;the script that bad little boys use when they write dirt on
walls: &ldquo;<i>I have everything that they have written: their pictures of
the country, and many letters. Especially the murasla. Tell me what to do. I am
at Shamlegh-under-the-Snow. The old man is sick.</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take this to him. It will altogether shut his mouth. He cannot have gone
far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed no. They are still in the forest across the spur. Our children
went to watch them when the light came, and have cried the news as they
moved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim looked his astonishment; but from the edge of the sheep-pasture floated a
shrill, kite-like trill. A child tending cattle had picked it up from a brother
or sister on the far side of the slope that commanded Chini valley.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My husbands are also out there gathering wood.&rdquo; She drew a handful
of walnuts from her bosom, split one neatly, and began to eat. Kim affected
blank ignorance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dost thou not know the meaning of the walnut&mdash;priest?&rdquo; she
said coyly, and handed him the half-shells.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well thought of.&rdquo; He slipped the piece of paper between them
quickly. &ldquo;Hast thou a little wax to close them on this letter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The woman sighed aloud, and Kim relented.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no payment till service has been rendered. Carry this to the
Babu, and say it was sent by the Son of the Charm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ai! Truly! Truly! By a magician&mdash;who is like a Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, a Son of the Charm: and ask if there be any answer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if he offer a rudeness? I&mdash;I am afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim laughed. &ldquo;He is, I have no doubt, very tired and very hungry. The
Hills make cold bedfellows. Hai, my&rdquo;&mdash;it was on the tip of his
tongue to say Mother, but he turned it to Sister&mdash;&ldquo;thou art a wise
and witty woman. By this time all the villages know what has befallen the
Sahibs&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True. News was at Ziglaur by midnight, and by tomorrow should be at
Kotgarh. The villages are both afraid and angry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No need. Tell the villages to feed the Sahibs and pass them on, in
peace. We must get them quietly away from our valleys. To steal is one
thing&mdash;to kill another. The Babu will understand, and there will be no
after-complaints. Be swift. I must tend my master when he wakes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So be it. After service&mdash;thou hast said?&mdash;comes the reward. I
am the Woman of Shamlegh, and I hold from the Rajah. I am no common bearer of
babes. Shamlegh is thine: hoof and horn and hide, milk and butter. Take or
leave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned resolutely uphill, her silver necklaces clicking on her broad
breast, to meet the morning sun fifteen hundred feet above them. This time Kim
thought in the vernacular as he waxed down the oilskin edges of the packets.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can a man follow the Way or the Great Game when he is
so&mdash;always pestered by women? There was that girl at Akrola of the Ford;
and there was the scullion&rsquo;s wife behind the dovecot&mdash;not counting
the others&mdash;and now comes this one! When I was a child it was well enough,
but now I am a man and they will not regard me as a man. Walnuts, indeed! Ho!
ho! It is almonds in the Plains!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went out to levy on the village&mdash;not with a begging-bowl, which might
do for down-country, but in the manner of a prince. Shamlegh&rsquo;s summer
population is only three families&mdash;four women and eight or nine men. They
were all full of tinned meats and mixed drinks, from ammoniated quinine to
white vodka, for they had taken their full share in the overnight loot. The
neat Continental tents had been cut up and shared long ago, and there were
patent aluminium saucepans abroad.
</p>

<p>
But they considered the lama&rsquo;s presence a perfect safeguard against all
consequences, and impenitently brought Kim of their best&mdash;even to a drink
of <i>chang</i>&mdash;the barley-beer that comes from Ladakh-way. Then they
thawed out in the sun, and sat with their legs hanging over infinite abysses,
chattering, laughing, and smoking. They judged India and its Government solely
from their experience of wandering Sahibs who had employed them or their
friends as <i>shikarris</i>. Kim heard tales of shots missed upon ibex, serow,
or markhor, by Sahibs twenty years in their graves&mdash;every detail lighted
from behind like twigs on tree-tops seen against lightning. They told him of
their little diseases, and, more important, the diseases of their tiny,
sure-footed cattle; of trips as far as Kotgarh, where the strange missionaries
live, and beyond even to marvellous Simla, where the streets are paved with
silver, and anyone, look you, can get service with the Sahibs, who ride about
in two-wheeled carts and spend money with a spade. Presently, grave and aloof,
walking very heavily, the lama joined himself to the chatter under the eaves,
and they gave him great room. The thin air refreshed him, and he sat on the
edge of precipices with the best of them, and, when talk languished, flung
pebbles into the void. Thirty miles away, as the eagle flies, lay the next
range, seamed and channelled and pitted with little patches of
brush&mdash;forests, each a day&rsquo;s dark march. Behind the village,
Shamlegh hill itself cut off all view to southward. It was like sitting in a
swallow&rsquo;s nest under the eaves of the roof of the world.
</p>

<p>
From time to time the lama stretched out his hand, and with a little low-voiced
prompting would point out the road to Spiti and north across the Parungla.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beyond, where the hills lie thickest, lies De-ch&rsquo;en&rdquo; (he
meant Han-lé&rsquo;), &ldquo;the great Monastery.
s&rsquo;Tag-stan-ras-ch&rsquo;en built it, and of him there runs this
tale.&rdquo; Whereupon he told it: a fantastic piled narrative of bewitchment
and miracles that set Shamlegh a-gasping. Turning west a little, he steered for
the green hills of Kulu, and sought Kailung under the glaciers. &ldquo;For
thither came I in the old, old days. From Leh I came, over the
Baralachi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes; we know it,&rdquo; said the far-faring people of Shamlegh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I slept two nights with the priests of Kailung. These are the Hills
of my delight! Shadows blessed above all other shadows! There my eyes opened on
this world; there my eyes were opened to this world; there I found
Enlightenment; and there I girt my loins for my Search. Out of the Hills I
came&mdash;the high Hills and the strong winds. Oh, just is the Wheel!&rdquo;
He blessed them in detail&mdash;the great glaciers, the naked rocks, the piled
moraines and tumbled shale; dry upland, hidden salt-lake, age-old timber and
fruitful water-shot valley one after the other, as a dying man blesses his
folk; and Kim marvelled at his passion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes. There is no place like our Hills,&rdquo; said the people
of Shamlegh. And they fell to wondering how a man could live in the hot
terrible Plains where the cattle run as big as elephants, unfit to plough on a
hillside; where village touches village, they had heard, for a hundred miles;
where folk went about stealing in gangs, and what the robbers spared the Police
carried utterly away.
</p>

<p>
So the still forenoon wore through, and at the end of it Kim&rsquo;s messenger
dropped from the steep pasture as unbreathed as when she had set out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I sent a word to the <i>hakim</i>,&rdquo; Kim explained, while she made
reverence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He joined himself to the idolaters? Nay, I remember he did a healing
upon one of them. He has acquired merit, though the healed employed his
strength for evil. Just is the Wheel! What of the <i>hakim?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I feared that thou hadst been bruised and&mdash;and I knew he was
wise.&rdquo; Kim took the waxed walnut-shell and read in English on the back of
his note: <i>Your favour received. Cannot get away from present company at
present, but shall take them into Simla. After which, hope to rejoin you.
Inexpedient to follow angry gentlemen. Return by same road you came, and will
overtake. Highly gratified about correspondence due to my forethought.</i>
&ldquo;He says, Holy One, that he will escape from the idolaters, and will
return to us. Shall we wait awhile at Shamlegh, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lama looked long and lovingly upon the hills and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That may not be, <i>chela</i>. From my bones outward I do desire it, but
it is forbidden. I have seen the Cause of Things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why? When the Hills give thee back thy strength day by day? Remember we
were weak and fainting down below there in the Doon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I became strong to do evil and to forget. A brawler and a swashbuckler
upon the hillsides was I.&rdquo; Kim bit back a smile. &ldquo;Just and perfect
is the Wheel, swerving not a hair. When I was a man&mdash;a long time
ago&mdash;I did pilgrimage to Guru Ch&rsquo;wan among the poplars&rdquo; (he
pointed Bhotanwards), &ldquo;where they keep the Sacred Horse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quiet, be quiet!&rdquo; said Shamlegh, all arow. &ldquo;He speaks of
Jam-lin-nin-k&rsquo;or, the Horse That Can Go Round The World In a Day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I speak to my <i>chela</i> only,&rdquo; said the lama, in gentle
reproof, and they scattered like frost on south eaves of a morning. &ldquo;I
did not seek truth in those days, but the talk of doctrine. All illusion! I
drank the beer and ate the bread of Guru Ch&rsquo;wan. Next day one said:
&lsquo;We go out to fight Sangor Gutok down the valley to discover&rsquo; (mark
again how Lust is tied to Anger!) &lsquo;which Abbot shall bear rule in the
valley and take the profit of the prayers they print at Sangor Gutok.&rsquo; I
went, and we fought a day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how, Holy One?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With our long pencases as I could have shown ... I say, we fought under
the poplars, both Abbots and all the monks, and one laid open my forehead to
the bone. See!&rdquo; He tilted back his cap and showed a puckered silvery
scar. &ldquo;Just and perfect is the Wheel! Yesterday the scar itched, and
after fifty years I recalled how it was dealt and the face of him who dealt it;
dwelling a little in illusion. Followed that which thou didst see&mdash;strife
and stupidity. Just is the Wheel! The idolater&rsquo;s blow fell upon the scar.
Then I was shaken in my soul: my soul was darkened, and the boat of my soul
rocked upon the waters of illusion. Not till I came to Shamlegh could I
meditate upon the Cause of Things, or trace the running grass-roots of Evil. I
strove all the long night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Holy One, thou art innocent of all evil. May I be thy
sacrifice!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim was genuinely distressed at the old man&rsquo;s sorrow, and Mahbub
Ali&rsquo;s phrase slipped out unawares.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the dawn,&rdquo; the lama went on more gravely, ready rosary clicking
between the slow sentences, &ldquo;came enlightenment. It is here ... I am an
old man ... hill-bred, hill-fed, never to sit down among my Hills. Three years
I travelled through Hind, but&mdash;can earth be stronger than Mother Earth? My
stupid body yearned to the Hills and the snows of the Hills, from below there.
I said, and it is true, my Search is sure. So, at the Kulu woman&rsquo;s house
I turned hillward, over-persuaded by myself. There is no blame to the
<i>hakim</i>. He&mdash;following Desire&mdash;foretold that the Hills would
make me strong. They strengthened me to do evil, to forget my Search. I
delighted in life and the lust of life. I desired strong slopes to climb. I
cast about to find them. I measured the strength of my body, which is evil,
against the high Hills, I made a mock of thee when thy breath came short under
Jamnotri. I jested when thou wouldst not face the snow of the pass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what harm? I <i>was</i> afraid. It was just. I am not a hillman; and
I loved thee for thy new strength.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More than once I remember&rdquo;&mdash;he rested his cheek dolefully on
his hand&mdash;&ldquo;I sought thy praise and the <i>hakim&rsquo;s</i> for the
mere strength of my legs. Thus evil followed evil till the cup was full. Just
is the Wheel! All Hind for three years did me all honour. From the Fountain of
Wisdom in the Wonder House to&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;a little
child playing by a big gun&mdash;the world prepared my road. And why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because we loved thee. It is only the fever of the blow. I myself am
still sick and shaken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No! It was because I was upon the Way&mdash;tuned as are <i>si-nen</i>
(cymbals) to the purpose of the Law. I departed from that ordinance. The tune
was broken: followed the punishment. In my own Hills, on the edge of my own
country, in the very place of my evil desire, comes the
buffet&mdash;here!&rdquo; (He touched his brow.) &ldquo;As a novice is beaten
when he misplaces the cups, so am I beaten, who was Abbot of Such-zen. No word,
look you, but a blow, <i>chela</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the Sahibs did not know thee, Holy One?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We were well matched. Ignorance and Lust met Ignorance and Lust upon the
road, and they begat Anger. The blow was a sign to me, who am no better than a
strayed yak, that my place is not here. Who can read the Cause of an act is
halfway to Freedom! &lsquo;Back to the path,&rsquo; says the Blow. &lsquo;The
Hills are not for thee. Thou canst not choose Freedom and go in bondage to the
delight of life.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would we had never met that cursed Russian!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our Lord Himself cannot make the Wheel swing backward. And for my merit
that I had acquired I gain yet another sign.&rdquo; He put his hand in his
bosom, and drew forth the Wheel of Life. &ldquo;Look! I considered this after I
had meditated. There remains untorn by the idolater no more than the breadth of
my fingernail.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So much, then, is the span of my life in this body. I have served the
Wheel all my days. Now the Wheel serves me. But for the merit I have acquired
in guiding thee upon the Way, there would have been added to me yet another
life ere I had found my River. Is it plain, <i>chela?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim stared at the brutally disfigured chart. From left to right diagonally the
rent ran&mdash;from the Eleventh House where Desire gives birth to the Child
(as it is drawn by Tibetans)&mdash;across the human and animal worlds, to the
Fifth House&mdash;the empty House of the Senses. The logic was unanswerable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Before our Lord won Enlightenment&rdquo;&mdash;the lama folded all away
with reverence&mdash;&ldquo;He was tempted. I too have been tempted, but it is
finished. The Arrow fell in the Plains&mdash;not in the Hills. Therefore, what
make we here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall we at least wait for the <i>hakim?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know how long I shall live in this body. What can a <i>hakim</i>
do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But thou art all sick and shaken. Thou canst not walk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I be sick if I see Freedom?&rdquo; He rose unsteadily to his
feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I must get food from the village. Oh, the weary Road!&rdquo; Kim
felt that he too needed rest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is lawful. Let us eat and go. The Arrow fell in the Plains ... but
I yielded to Desire. Make ready, <i>chela</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim turned to the woman with the turquoise headgear who had been idly pitching
pebbles over the cliff. She smiled very kindly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I found him like a strayed buffalo in a cornfield&mdash;the Babu;
snorting and sneezing with cold. He was so hungry that he forgot his dignity
and gave me sweet words. The Sahibs have nothing.&rdquo; She flung out an empty
palm. &ldquo;One is very sick about the stomach. Thy work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim nodded, with a bright eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I spoke to the Bengali first&mdash;and to the people of a near-by
village after. The Sahibs will be given food as they need it&mdash;nor will the
people ask money. The plunder is already distributed. The Babu makes lying
speeches to the Sahibs. Why does he not leave them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out of the greatness of his heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was never a Bengali yet had one bigger than a dried walnut. But it is no
matter ... Now as to walnuts. After service comes reward. I have said the
village is thine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is my loss,&rdquo; Kim began. &ldquo;Even now I had planned desirable
things in my heart which&rdquo;&mdash;there is no need to go through the
compliments proper to these occasions. He sighed deeply ... &ldquo;But my
master, led by a vision&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Huh! What can old eyes see except a full begging-bowl?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;turns from this village to the Plains again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bid him stay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim shook his head. &ldquo;I know my Holy One, and his rage if he be
crossed,&rdquo; he replied impressively. &ldquo;His curses shake the
Hills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pity they did not save him from a broken head! I heard that thou wast
the tiger-hearted one who smote the Sahib. Let him dream a little longer.
Stay!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hillwoman,&rdquo; said Kim, with austerity that could not harden the
outlines of his young oval face, &ldquo;these matters are too high for
thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Gods be good to us! Since when have men and women been other than
men and women?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A priest is a priest. He says he will go upon this hour. I am his
<i>chela</i>, and I go with him. We need food for the Road. He is an honoured
guest in all the villages, but&rdquo;&mdash;he broke into a pure boy&rsquo;s
grin&mdash;&ldquo;the food here is good. Give me some.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What if I do not give it thee? I am the woman of this village.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I curse thee&mdash;a little&mdash;not greatly, but enough to
remember.&rdquo; He could not help smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou hast cursed me already by the down-dropped eyelash and the uplifted
chin. Curses? What should I care for mere words?&rdquo; She clenched her hands
upon her bosom ... &ldquo;But I would not have thee to go in anger, thinking
hardly of me&mdash;a gatherer of cow-dung and grass at Shamlegh, but still a
woman of substance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think nothing,&rdquo; said Kim, &ldquo;but that I am grieved to go,
for I am very weary; and that we need food. Here is the bag.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The woman snatched it angrily. &ldquo;I was foolish,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Who is thy woman in the Plains? Fair or black? I was fair once. Laughest
thou? Once, long ago, if thou canst believe, a Sahib looked on me with favour.
Once, long ago, I wore European clothes at the Mission-house yonder.&rdquo; She
pointed towards Kotgarh. &ldquo;Once, long ago. I was <i>Ker-lis-ti-an</i> and
spoke English&mdash;as the Sahibs speak it. Yes. My Sahib said he would return
and wed me&mdash;yes, wed me. He went away&mdash;I had nursed him when he was
sick&mdash;but he never returned. Then I saw that the Gods of the Kerlistians
lied, and I went back to my own people ... I have never set eyes on a Sahib
since. (Do not laugh at me. The fit is past, little priestling.) Thy face and
thy walk and thy fashion of speech put me in mind of my Sahib, though thou art
only a wandering mendicant to whom I give a dole. Curse me? Thou canst neither
curse nor bless!&rdquo; She set her hands on her hips and laughed bitterly.
&ldquo;Thy Gods are lies; thy works are lies; thy words are lies. There are no
Gods under all the Heavens. I know it ... But for awhile I thought it was my
Sahib come back, and he was my God. Yes, once I made music on a <i>pianno</i>
in the Mission-house at Kotgarh. Now I give alms to priests who are
<i>heatthen</i>.&rdquo; She wound up with the English word, and tied the mouth
of the brimming bag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wait for thee, <i>chela</i>,&rdquo; said the lama, leaning against the
door-post.
</p>

<p>
The woman swept the tall figure with her eyes. &ldquo;He walk! He cannot cover
half a mile. Whither would old bones go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this Kim, already perplexed by the lama&rsquo;s collapse and foreseeing the
weight of the bag, fairly lost his temper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it to thee, woman of ill-omen, where he goes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;but something to thee, priest with a Sahib&rsquo;s face.
Wilt thou carry him on thy shoulders?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I go to the Plains. None must hinder my return. I have wrestled with my
soul till I am strengthless. The stupid body is spent, and we are far from the
Plains.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; she said simply, and drew aside to let Kim see his own
utter helplessness. &ldquo;Curse me. Maybe it will give him strength. Make a
charm! Call on thy great God. Thou art a priest.&rdquo; She turned away.
</p>

<p>
The lama had squatted limply, still holding by the door-post. One cannot strike
down an old man that he recovers again like a boy in the night. Weakness bowed
him to the earth, but his eyes that hung on Kim were alive and imploring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is all well,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;It is the thin air that weakens
thee. In a little while we go! It is the mountain-sickness. I too am a little
sick at stomach,&rdquo;&mdash;and he knelt and comforted with such poor words
as came first to his lips. Then the woman returned, more erect than ever.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thy Gods useless, heh? Try mine. I am the Woman of Shamlegh.&rdquo; She
hailed hoarsely, and there came out of a cow-pen her two husbands and three
others with a <i>dooli</i>, the rude native litter of the Hills, that they use
for carrying the sick and for visits of state. &ldquo;These
cattle&rdquo;&mdash;she did not condescend to look at them&mdash;&ldquo;are
thine for so long as thou shalt need.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But we will not go Simla-way. We will not go near the Sahibs,&rdquo;
cried the first husband.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They will not run away as the others did, nor will they steal baggage.
Two I know for weaklings. Stand to the rear-pole, Sonoo and Taree.&rdquo; They
obeyed swiftly. &ldquo;Lower now, and lift in that holy man. I will see to the
village and your virtuous wives till ye return.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When will that be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ask the priests. Do not pester me. Lay the food-bag at the foot, it
balances better so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Holy One, thy Hills are kinder than our Plains!&rdquo; cried Kim,
relieved, as the lama tottered to the litter. &ldquo;It is a very king&rsquo;s
bed&mdash;a place of honour and ease. And we owe it to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A woman of ill-omen. I need thy blessings as much as I do thy curses. It
is <i>my</i> order and none of thine. Lift and away! Here! Hast thou money for
the road?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She beckoned Kim to her hut, and stooped above a battered English cash-box
under her cot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not need anything,&rdquo; said Kim, angered where he should have
been grateful. &ldquo;I am already rudely loaded with favours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked up with a curious smile and laid a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;At
least, thank me. I am foul-faced and a hillwoman, but, as thy talk goes, I have
acquired merit. Shall I show thee how the Sahibs render thanks?&rdquo; and her
hard eyes softened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am but a wandering priest,&rdquo; said Kim, his eyes lighting in
answer. &ldquo;Thou needest neither my blessings nor my curses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay. But for one little moment&mdash;thou canst overtake the
<i>dooli</i> in ten strides&mdash;<i>if</i> thou wast a Sahib, shall I show
thee what thou wouldst do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How if I guess, though?&rdquo; said Kim, and putting his arm round her
waist, he kissed her on the cheek, adding in English: &ldquo;Thank you verree
much, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kissing is practically unknown among Asiatics, which may have been the reason
that she leaned back with wide-open eyes and a face of panic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; Kim went on, &ldquo;you must not be so sure of your
heatthen priests. Now I say good-bye.&rdquo; He held out his hand
English-fashion. She took it mechanically. &ldquo;Good-bye, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye, and&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;she was remembering her English
words one by one&mdash;&ldquo;you will come back again? Good-bye,
and&mdash;thee God bless you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, as the creaking litter jolted up the hill path that leads
south-easterly from Shamlegh, Kim saw a tiny figure at the hut door waving a
white rag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has acquired merit beyond all others,&rdquo; said the lama.
&ldquo;For to set a man upon the way to Freedom is half as great as though she
had herself found it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Umm,&rdquo; said Kim thoughtfully, considering the past. &ldquo;It may
be that I have acquired merit also ... At least she did not treat me like a
child.&rdquo; He hitched the front of his robe, where lay the slab of documents
and maps, re-stowed the precious food-bag at the lama&rsquo;s feet, laid his
hand on the litter&rsquo;s edge, and buckled down to the slow pace of the
grunting husbands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These also acquire merit,&rdquo; said the lama after three miles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More than that, they shall be paid in silver,&rdquo; quoth Kim. The
Woman of Shamlegh had given it to him; and it was only fair, he argued, that
her men should earn it back again.

<p>
Two hundred miles north of Chini, on the blue shale of Ladakh, lies Yankling
Sahib, the merry-minded man, spy-glassing wrathfully across the ridges for some
sign of his pet tracker&mdash;a man from Ao-chung. But that renegade, with a
new Mannlicher rifle and two hundred cartridges, is elsewhere, shooting
musk-deer for the market, and Yankling Sahib will learn next season how very
ill he has been.
</p>

<p>
Up the valleys of Bushahr&mdash;the far-beholding eagles of the Himalayas
swerve at his new blue-and-white gored umbrella&mdash;hurries a Bengali, once
fat and well-looking, now lean and weather-worn. He has received the thanks of
two foreigners of distinction, piloted not unskilfully to Mashobra tunnel,
which leads to the great and gay capital of India. It was not his fault that,
blanketed by wet mists, he conveyed them past the telegraph-station and
European colony of Kotgarh. It was not his fault, but that of the Gods, of whom
he discoursed so engagingly, that he led them into the borders of Nahan, where
the Rajah of that state mistook them for deserting British soldiery. Hurree
Babu explained the greatness and glory, in their own country, of his
companions, till the drowsy kinglet smiled. He explained it to everyone who
asked&mdash;many times&mdash;aloud&mdash;variously. He begged food, arranged
accommodation, proved a skilful leech for an injury of the groin&mdash;such a
blow as one may receive rolling down a rock-covered hillside in the
dark&mdash;and in all things indispensable. The reason of his friendliness did
him credit. With millions of fellow-serfs, he had learned to look upon Russia
as the great deliverer from the North. He was a fearful man. He had been afraid
that he could not save his illustrious employers from the anger of an excited
peasantry. He himself would just as lief hit a holy man as not, but ... He was
deeply grateful and sincerely rejoiced that he had done his &ldquo;little
possible&rdquo; towards bringing their venture to&mdash;barring the lost
baggage&mdash;a successful issue, he had forgotten the blows; denied that any
blows had been dealt that unseemly first night under the pines. He asked
neither pension nor retaining fee, but, if they deemed him worthy, would they
write him a testimonial? It might be useful to him later, if others, their
friends, came over the Passes. He begged them to remember him in their future
greatnesses, for he &ldquo;opined subtly&rdquo; that he, even he, Mohendro Lal
Dutt, MA of Calcutta, had &ldquo;done the State some service&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
They gave him a certificate praising his courtesy, helpfulness, and unerring
skill as a guide. He put it in his waist-belt and sobbed with emotion; they had
endured so many dangers together. He led them at high noon along crowded Simla
Mall to the Alliance Bank of Simla, where they wished to establish their
identity. Thence he vanished like a dawn-cloud on Jakko.
</p>

<p>
Behold him, too fine-drawn to sweat, too pressed to vaunt the drugs in his
little brass-bound box, ascending Shamlegh slope, a just man made perfect.
Watch him, all Babudom laid aside, smoking at noon on a cot, while a woman with
turquoise-studded headgear points south-easterly across the bare grass.
Litters, she says, do not travel as fast as single men, but his birds should
now be in the Plains. The holy man would not stay though Lispeth pressed him.
The Babu groans heavily, girds up his huge loins, and is off again. He does not
care to travel after dusk; but his days&rsquo; marches&mdash;there is none to
enter them in a book&mdash;would astonish folk who mock at his race. Kindly
villagers, remembering the Dacca drug-vendor of two months ago, give him
shelter against evil spirits of the wood. He dreams of Bengali Gods, University
text-books of education, and the Royal Society, London, England. Next dawn the
bobbing blue-and-white umbrella goes forward.
</p>

<p>
On the edge of the Doon, Mussoorie well behind them and the Plains spread out
in golden dust before, rests a worn litter in which&mdash;all the Hills know
it&mdash;lies a sick lama who seeks a River for his healing. Villages have
almost come to blows over the honour of bearing it, for not only has the lama
given them blessings, but his disciple good money&mdash;full one-third
Sahibs&rsquo; prices. Twelve miles a day has the <i>dooli</i> travelled, as the
greasy, rubbed pole-ends show, and by roads that few Sahibs use. Over the
Nilang Pass in storm when the driven snow-dust filled every fold of the
impassive lama&rsquo;s drapery; between the black horns of Raieng where they
heard the whistle of the wild goats through the clouds; pitching and strained
on the shale below; hard-held between shoulder and clenched jaw when they
rounded the hideous curves of the Cut Road under Bhagirati; swinging and
creaking to the steady jog-trot of the descent into the Valley of the Waters;
pressed along the steamy levels of that locked valley; up, up and out again, to
meet the roaring gusts off Kedarnath; set down of mid-days in the dun gloom of
kindly oak-forests; passed from village to village in dawn-chill, when even
devotees may be forgiven for swearing at impatient holy men; or by torchlight,
when the least fearful think of ghosts&mdash;the <i>dooli</i> has reached her
last stage. The little hill-folk sweat in the modified heat of the lower
Siwaliks, and gather round the priests for their blessing and their wage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye have acquired merit,&rdquo; says the lama. &ldquo;Merit greater than
your knowing. And ye will return to the Hills,&rdquo; he sighs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely. The high Hills as soon as may be.&rdquo; The bearer rubs his
shoulder, drinks water, spits it out again, and readjusts his grass sandal.
Kim&mdash;his face is drawn and tired&mdash;pays very small silver from his
belt, heaves out the food-bag, crams an oilskin packet&mdash;they are holy
writings&mdash;into his bosom, and helps the lama to his feet. The peace has
come again into the old man&rsquo;s eyes, and he does not look for the hills to
fall down and crush him as he did that terrible night when they were delayed by
the flooded river.
</p>

<p>
The men pick up the <i>dooli</i> and swing out of sight between the scrub
clumps.
</p>

<p>
The lama raises a hand toward the rampart of the Himalayas. &ldquo;Not with
you, O blessed among all hills, fell the Arrow of Our Lord! And never shall I
breathe your airs again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But thou art ten times the stronger man in this good air,&rdquo; says
Kim, for to his wearied soul appeal the well-cropped, kindly Plains.
&ldquo;Here, or hereabouts, fell the Arrow, yes. We will go very softly,
perhaps, a <i>kos</i> a day, for the Search is sure. But the bag weighs
heavy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, our Search is sure. I have come out of great temptation.&rdquo;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
It was never more than a couple of miles a day now, and Kim&rsquo;s shoulders
bore all the weight of it&mdash;the burden of an old man, the burden of the
heavy food-bag with the locked books, the load of the writings on his heart,
and the details of the daily routine. He begged in the dawn, set blankets for
the lama&rsquo;s meditation, held the weary head on his lap through the noonday
heats, fanning away the flies till his wrists ached, begged again in the
evenings, and rubbed the lama&rsquo;s feet, who rewarded him with promise of
Freedom&mdash;today, tomorrow, or, at furthest, the next day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never was such a <i>chela</i>. I doubt at times whether Ananda more
faithfully nursed Our Lord. And thou art a Sahib? When I was a man&mdash;a long
time ago&mdash;I forgot that. Now I look upon thee often, and every time I
remember that thou art a Sahib. It is strange.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou hast said there is neither black nor white. Why plague me with this
talk, Holy One? Let me rub the other foot. It vexes me. I am <i>not</i> a
Sahib. I am thy <i>chela</i>, and my head is heavy on my shoulders.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Patience a little! We reach Freedom together. Then thou and I, upon the
far bank of the River, will look back upon our lives as in the Hills we saw our
days&rsquo; marches laid out behind us. Perhaps I was once a Sahib.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was never a Sahib like thee, I swear it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am certain the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House was in past
life a very wise Abbot. But even his spectacles do not make my eyes see. There
fall shadows when I would look steadily. No matter&mdash;we know the tricks of
the poor stupid carcass&mdash;shadow changing to another shadow. I am bound by
the illusion of Time and Space. How far came we today in the flesh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps half a koss.&rdquo; (Three quarters of a mile, and it was a
weary march.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Half a koss. Ha! I went ten thousand thousand in the spirit. How, we are
all lapped and swathed and swaddled in these senseless things.&rdquo; He looked
at his thin blue-veined hand that found the beads so heavy.
&ldquo;<i>Chela</i>, hast thou never a wish to leave me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim thought of the oilskin packet and the books in the food-bag. If someone
duly authorized would only take delivery of them the Great Game might play
itself for aught he then cared. He was tired and hot in his head, and a cough
that came from the stomach worried him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; he said almost sternly. &ldquo;I am not a dog or a snake to
bite when I have learned to love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou art too tender towards me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not that either. I have moved in one matter without consulting thee. I
have sent a message to the Kulu woman by that woman who gave us the
goat&rsquo;s milk this morn, saying that thou wast a little feeble and wouldst
need a litter. I beat myself in my mind that I did not do it when we entered
the Doon. We stay in this place till the litter returns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am content. She is a woman with a heart of gold, as thou sayest, but a
talker&mdash;something of a talker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She will not weary thee. I have looked to that also. Holy One, my heart
is very heavy for my many carelessnesses towards thee.&rdquo; An hysterical
catch rose in his throat. &ldquo;I have walked thee too far: I have not picked
good food always for thee; I have not considered the heat; I have talked to
people on the road and left thee alone ... I have&mdash;I have ... <i>Hai
mai!</i> But I love thee ... and it is all too late ... I was a child ... Oh,
why was I not a man? ...&rdquo; Overborne by strain, fatigue, and the weight
beyond his years, Kim broke down and sobbed at the lama&rsquo;s feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a to-do is here!&rdquo; said the old man gently. &ldquo;Thou hast
never stepped a hair&rsquo;s breadth from the Way of Obedience. Neglect me?
Child, I have lived on thy strength as an old tree lives on the lime of a new
wall. Day by day, since Shamlegh down, I have stolen strength from thee.
<i>Therefore</i>, not through any sin of thine, art thou weakened. It is the
Body&mdash;the silly, stupid Body&mdash;that speaks now. Not the assured Soul.
Be comforted! Know at least the devils that thou fightest. They are
earth-born&mdash;children of illusion. We will go to the woman from Kulu. She
shall acquire merit in housing us, and specially in tending me. Thou shalt run
free till strength returns. I had forgotten the stupid Body. If there be any
blame, I bear it. But we are too close to the Gates of Deliverance to weigh
blame. I could praise thee, but what need? In a little&mdash;in a very
little&mdash;we shall sit beyond all needs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so he petted and comforted Kim with wise saws and grave texts on that
little-understood beast, our Body, who, being but a delusion, insists on posing
as the Soul, to the darkening of the Way, and the immense multiplication of
unnecessary devils.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hai! hai! Let us talk of the woman from Kulu. Think you she will ask
another charm for her grandsons? When I was a young man, a very long time ago,
I was plagued with these vapours&mdash;and some others&mdash;and I went to an
Abbot&mdash;a very holy man and a seeker after truth, though then I knew it
not. Sit up and listen, child of my soul! My tale was told. Said he to me,
&lsquo;<i>Chela</i>, know this. There are many lies in the world, and not a few
liars, but there are no liars like our bodies, except it be the sensations of
our bodies.&rsquo; Considering this I was comforted, and of his great favour he
suffered me to drink tea In his presence. Suffer me now to drink tea, for I am
thirsty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a laugh across his tears, Kim kissed the lama&rsquo;s feet, and set about
the tea-making.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou leanest on me in the body, Holy One, but I lean on thee for some
other things. Dost know it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have guessed maybe,&rdquo; and the lama&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.
&ldquo;We must change that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So, when with scufflings and scrapings and a hot air of importance, paddled up
nothing less than the Sahiba&rsquo;s pet palanquin sent twenty miles, with that
same grizzled old Oorya servant in charge, and when they reached the disorderly
order of the long white rambling house behind Saharunpore, the lama took his
own measures.
</p>

<p>
Said the Sahiba cheerily from an upper window, after compliments: &ldquo;What
is the good of an old woman&rsquo;s advice to an old man? I told thee&mdash;I
<i>told</i> thee, Holy One, to keep an eye upon the <i>chela</i>. How didst
thou do it? Never answer me! <i>I</i> know. He has been running among the
women. Look at his eyes&mdash;hollow and sunk&mdash;and the Betraying Line from
the nose down! He has been sifted out! Fie! Fie! And a priest, too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim looked up, over-weary to smile, shaking his head in denial.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not jest,&rdquo; said the lama. &ldquo;That time is done. We are here
upon great matters. A sickness of soul took me in the Hills, and him a sickness
of the body. Since then I have lived upon his strength&mdash;eating him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Children together&mdash;young and old,&rdquo; she sniffed, but forbore
to make any new jokes. &ldquo;May this present hospitality restore ye! Hold
awhile and I will come to gossip of the high good Hills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At evening time&mdash;her son-in-law was returned, so she did not need to go on
inspection round the farm&mdash;she won to the meat of the matter, explained
low-voicedly by the lama. The two old heads nodded wisely together. Kim had
reeled to a room with a cot in it, and was dozing soddenly. The lama had
forbidden him to set blankets or get food.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know. Who but I?&rdquo; she cackled. &ldquo;We who go
down to the burning-ghats clutch at the hands of those coming up from the River
of Life with full water-jars&mdash;yes, brimming water-jars. I did the boy
wrong. He lent thee his strength? It is true that the old eat the young daily.
Stands now we must restore him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou hast many times acquired merit&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>My</i> merit. What is it? Old bag of bones making curries for men who
do not ask &lsquo;Who cooked this?&rsquo; Now if it were stored up for my
grandson&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He that had the belly-pain?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To think the Holy One remembers <i>that!</i> I must tell his mother. It
is most singular honour! &lsquo;He that had the
belly-pain&rsquo;&mdash;straightway the Holy One remembered. She will be
proud.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My <i>chela</i> is to me as is a son to the unenlightened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say grandson, rather. Mothers have not the wisdom of our years. If a
child cries they say the heavens are falling. Now a grandmother is far enough
separated from the pain of bearing and the pleasure of giving the breast to
consider whether a cry is wickedness pure or the wind. And since thou speakest
once again of wind, when last the Holy One was here, maybe I offended in
pressing for charms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said the lama, using that form of address a Buddhist monk
may sometimes employ towards a nun, &ldquo;if charms comfort thee&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are better than ten thousand doctors.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, if they comfort thee, I who was Abbot of Such-zen, will make as
many as thou mayest desire. I have never seen thy face&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>That</i> even the monkeys who steal our loquats count for again. Hee!
hee!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But as he who sleeps there said,&rdquo;&mdash;he nodded at the shut door
of the guest-chamber across the forecourt&mdash;&ldquo;thou hast a heart of
gold... And he is in the spirit my very &lsquo;grandson&rsquo; to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good! I am the Holy One&rsquo;s cow.&rdquo; This was pure Hinduism, but
the lama never heeded. &ldquo;I am old. I have borne sons in the body. Oh, once
I could please men! Now I can cure them.&rdquo; He heard her armlets tinkle as
though she bared arms for action. &ldquo;I will take over the boy and dose him,
and stuff him, and make him all whole. Hai! hai! We old people know something
yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wherefore when Kim, aching in every bone, opened his eyes, and would go to the
cook-house to get his master&rsquo;s food, he found strong coercion about him,
and a veiled old figure at the door, flanked by the grizzled manservant, who
told him very precisely the things that he was on no account to do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou must have? Thou shalt have nothing. What? A locked box in which to
keep holy books? Oh, that is another matter. Heavens forbid I should come
between a priest and his prayers! It shall be brought, and thou shalt keep the
key.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They pushed the coffer under his cot, and Kim shut away Mahbub&rsquo;s pistol,
the oilskin packet of letters, and the locked books and diaries, with a groan
of relief. For some absurd reason their weight on his shoulders was nothing to
their weight on his poor mind. His neck ached under it of nights.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thine is a sickness uncommon in youth these days: since young folk have
given up tending their betters. The remedy is sleep, and certain drugs,&rdquo;
said the Sahiba; and he was glad to give himself up to the blankness that half
menaced and half soothed him.
</p>

<p>
She brewed drinks, in some mysterious Asiatic equivalent to the
still-room&mdash;drenches that smelt pestilently and tasted worse. She stood
over Kim till they went down, and inquired exhaustively after they had come up.
She laid a taboo upon the forecourt, and enforced it by means of an armed man.
It is true he was seventy odd, that his scabbarded sword ceased at the hilt;
but he represented the authority of the Sahiba, and loaded wains, chattering
servants, calves, dogs, hens, and the like, fetched a wide compass by those
parts. Best of all, when the body was cleared, she cut out from the mass of
poor relations that crowded the back of the buildings&mdash;house-hold dogs, we
name them&mdash;a cousin&rsquo;s widow, skilled in what Europeans, who know
nothing about it, call massage. And the two of them, laying him east and west,
that the mysterious earth-currents which thrill the clay of our bodies might
help and not hinder, took him to pieces all one long afternoon&mdash;bone by
bone, muscle by muscle, ligament by ligament, and lastly, nerve by nerve.
Kneaded to irresponsible pulp, half hypnotized by the perpetual flick and
readjustment of the uneasy <i>chudders</i> that veiled their eyes, Kim slid ten
thousand miles into slumber&mdash;thirty-six hours of it&mdash;sleep that
soaked like rain after drought.
</p>

<p>
Then she fed him, and the house spun to her clamour. She caused fowls to be
slain; she sent for vegetables, and the sober, slow-thinking gardener, nigh as
old as she, sweated for it; she took spices, and milk, and onion, with little
fish from the brooks&mdash;anon limes for sherbets, fat quails from the pits,
then chicken-livers upon a skewer, with sliced ginger between.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have seen something of this world,&rdquo; she said over the crowded
trays, &ldquo;and there are but two sorts of women in it&mdash;those who take
the strength out of a man and those who put it back. Once I was that one, and
now I am this. Nay&mdash;do not play the priestling with me. Mine was but a
jest. If it does not hold good now, it will when thou takest the road again.
Cousin,&rdquo;&mdash;this to the poor relation, never wearied of extolling her
patroness&rsquo;s charity&mdash;&ldquo;he is getting a bloom on the skin of a
new-curried horse. Our work is like polishing jewels to be thrown to a
dance-girl&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim sat up and smiled. The terrible weakness had dropped from him like an old
shoe. His tongue itched for free speech again, and but a week back the lightest
word clogged it like ashes. The pain in his neck (he must have caught it from
the lama) had gone with the heavy dengue-aches and the evil taste in the mouth.
The two old women, a little, but not much, more careful about their veils now,
clucked as merrily as the hens that had entered pecking through the open door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is my Holy One?&rdquo; he demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear him! Thy Holy One is well,&rdquo; she snapped viciously.
&ldquo;Though that is none of <i>his</i> merit. Knew I a charm to make him
wise, I&rsquo;d sell my jewels and buy it. To refuse good food that I cooked
myself&mdash;and go roving into the fields for two nights on an empty
belly&mdash;and to tumble into a brook at the end of it&mdash;call you
<i>that</i> holiness? Then, when he has nearly broken what thou hast left of my
heart with anxiety, he tells me that he has acquired merit. Oh, how like are
all men! No, that was not it&mdash;he tells me that he is freed from all sin.
<i>I</i> could have told him that before he wetted himself all over. He is well
now&mdash;this happened a week ago&mdash;but burn me such holiness! A babe of
three would do better. Do not fret thyself for the Holy One. He keeps both eyes
on thee when he is not wading our brooks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not remember to have seen him. I remember that the days and nights
passed like bars of white and black, opening and shutting. I was not sick: I
was but tired.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A lethargy that comes by right some few score years later. But it is
done now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maharanee,&rdquo; Kim began, but led by the look in her eye, changed it
to the title of plain love&mdash;&ldquo;Mother, I owe my life to thee. How
shall I make thanks? Ten thousand blessings upon thy house and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The house be unblessed!&rdquo; (It is impossible to give exactly the old
lady&rsquo;s word.) &ldquo;Thank the Gods as a priest if thou wilt, but thank
me, if thou carest, as a son. Heavens above! Have I shifted thee and lifted
thee and slapped and twisted thy ten toes to find texts flung at my head?
Somewhere a mother must have borne thee to break her heart. What used thou to
her&mdash;son?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had no mother, my mother,&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;She died, they tell
me, when I was young.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Hai mai!</i> Then none can say I have robbed her of any right
if&mdash;when thou takest the road again and this house is but one of a
thousand used for shelter and forgotten, after an easy-flung blessing. No
matter. I need no blessings, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; She stamped her foot
at the poor relation. &ldquo;Take up the trays to the house. What is the good
of stale food in the room, O woman of ill-omen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ha&mdash;have borne a son in my time too, but he died,&rdquo;
whimpered the bowed sister-figure behind the <i>chudder</i>. &ldquo;Thou
knowest he died! I only waited for the order to take away the tray.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is I that am the woman of ill-omen,&rdquo; cried the old lady
penitently. &ldquo;We that go down to the <i>chattris</i> (the big umbrellas
above the burning-ghats where the priests take their last dues) clutch hard at
the bearers of the <i>chattis</i> (water-jars&mdash;young folk full of the
pride of life, she meant; but the pun is clumsy). When one cannot dance in the
festival one must e&rsquo;en look out of the window, and grandmothering takes
all a woman&rsquo;s time. Thy master gives me all the charms I now desire for
my daughter&rsquo;s eldest, by reason&mdash;is it?&mdash;that he is wholly free
from sin. The <i>hakim</i> is brought very low these days. He goes about
poisoning my servants for lack of their betters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What <i>hakim</i>, mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That very Dacca man who gave me the pill which rent me in three pieces.
He cast up like a strayed camel a week ago, vowing that he and thou had been
blood-brothers together up Kulu-way, and feigning great anxiety for thy health.
He was very thin and hungry, so I gave orders to have him stuffed too&mdash;him
and his anxiety!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would see him if he is here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He eats five times a day, and lances boils for my hinds to save himself
from an apoplexy. He is so full of anxiety for thy health that he sticks to the
cook-house door and stays himself with scraps. He will keep. We shall never get
rid of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Send him here, mother&rdquo;&mdash;the twinkle returned to Kim&rsquo;s
eye for a flash&mdash;&ldquo;and I will try.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send him, but to chase him off is an ill turn. At least he
had the sense to fish the Holy One out of the brook; thus, as the Holy One did
<i>not</i> say, acquiring merit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a very wise <i>hakim</i>. Send him, mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Priest praising priest? A miracle! If he is any friend of thine (ye
squabbled at your last meeting) I&rsquo;ll hale him here with horse-ropes
and&mdash;and give him a caste-dinner afterwards, my son ... Get up and see the
world! This lying abed is the mother of seventy devils ... my son! my
son!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She trotted forth to raise a typhoon off the cook-house, and almost on her
shadow rolled in the Babu, robed as to the shoulders like a Roman emperor,
jowled like Titus, bare-headed, with new patent-leather shoes, in highest
condition of fat, exuding joy and salutations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, Mister O&rsquo;Hara, but I <i>am</i> jolly glad to see you. I
will kindly shut the door. It is a pity you are sick. Are you very sick?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The papers&mdash;the papers from the <i>kilta</i>. The maps and the
<i>murasla!</i>&rdquo; He held out the key impatiently; for the present need on
his soul was to get rid of the loot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are quite right. That is correct Departmental view to take. You have
got everything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All that was handwritten in the <i>kilta</i> I took. The rest I threw
down the hill.&rdquo; He could hear the key&rsquo;s grate in the lock, the
sticky pull of the slow-rending oilskin, and a quick shuffling of papers. He
had been annoyed out of all reason by the knowledge that they lay below him
through the sick idle days&mdash;a burden incommunicable. For that reason the
blood tingled through his body, when Hurree, skipping elephantinely, shook
hands again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is fine! This is finest! Mister O&rsquo;Hara! you have&mdash;ha!
ha! swiped the whole bag of tricks&mdash;locks, stocks, and barrels. They told
me it was eight months&rsquo; work gone up the spouts! By Jove, how they beat
me! ... Look, here is the letter from Hilás!&rdquo; He intoned a line or two of
Court Persian, which is the language of authorized and unauthorized diplomacy.
&ldquo;Mister Rajah Sahib has just about put his foot in the holes. He will
have to explain offeecially how the deuce-an&rsquo;-all he is writing
love-letters to the Czar. And they are very clever maps ... and there is three
or four Prime Ministers of these parts implicated by the correspondence. By
Gad, sar! The British Government will change the succession in Hilás and Bunár,
and nominate new heirs to the throne. &lsquo;Trea-son most base&rsquo; ... but
you do not understand? Eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are they in thy hands?&rdquo; said Kim. It was all he cared for.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just you jolly-well bet yourself they are.&rdquo; He stowed the entire
trove about his body, as only Orientals can. &ldquo;They are going up to the
office, too. The old lady thinks I am permanent fixture here, but I shall go
away with these straight off&mdash;immediately. Mr Lurgan will be proud man.
You are offeecially subordinate to me, but I shall embody your name in my
verbal report. It is a pity we are not allowed written reports. We Bengalis
excel in thee exact science.&rdquo; He tossed back the key and showed the box
empty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good. That is good. I was very tired. My Holy One was sick, too. And did
he fall into&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah yess. I am his good friend, I tell you. He was behaving very strange
when I came down after you, and I thought perhaps he might have the papers. I
followed him on his meditations, and to discuss ethnological points also. You
see, I am verree small person here nowadays, in comparison with all his charms.
By Jove, O&rsquo;Hara, do you know, he is afflicted with infirmity of fits.
Yess, I tell you. Cataleptic, too, if not also epileptic. I found him in such a
state under a tree <i>in articulo mortem</i>, and he jumped up and walked into
a brook and he was nearly drowned but for me. I pulled him out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I was not there!&rdquo; said Kim. &ldquo;He might have
died.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he might have died, but he is dry now, and asserts he has undergone
transfiguration.&rdquo; The Babu tapped his forehead knowingly. &ldquo;I took
notes of his statements for Royal Society&mdash;<i>in posse</i>. You must make
haste and be quite well and come back to Simla, and I will tell you all my tale
at Lurgan&rsquo;s. It was splendid. The bottoms of their trousers were
<i>quite</i> torn, and old Nahan Rajah, he thought they were European soldiers
deserting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the Russians? How long were they with thee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One was a Frenchman. Oh, days and days and days! Now all the hill-people
believe all Russians are all beggars. By Jove! they had not one
dam&rsquo;-thing that I did not get them. And I told the common
people&mdash;oah, <i>such</i> tales and anecdotes!&mdash;I will tell you at old
Lurgan&rsquo;s when you come up. We will have&mdash;ah&mdash;a night out! It is
feather in both our caps! Yess, and they gave me a certificate. That is
creaming joke. You should have seen them at the Alliance Bank identifying
themselves! And thank Almighty God you got their papers so well! You do not
laugh verree much, but you shall laugh when you are well. Now I will go
straight to the railway and get out. You shall have all sorts of credits for
your game. When do you come along? We are very proud of you though you gave us
great frights. And especially Mahbub.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, Mahbub. And where is he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Selling horses in this vi-cinity, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here! Why? Speak slowly. There is a thickness in my head still.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Babu looked shyly down his nose. &ldquo;Well, you see, I am fearful man,
and I do not like responsibility. You were sick, you see, and I did not know
where deuce-an&rsquo;-all the papers were, and if so, how many. So when I had
come down here I slipped in private wire to Mahbub&mdash;he was at Meerut for
races&mdash;and I tell him how case stands. He comes up with his men and he
consorts with the lama, and then he calls me a fool, and is very
rude&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But wherefore&mdash;wherefore?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is what <i>I</i> ask. I only suggest that if anyone steals the
papers I should like some good strong, brave men to rob them back again. You
see, they are vitally important, and Mahbub Ali he did not know where you
were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mahbub Ali to rob the Sahiba&rsquo;s house? Thou art mad, Babu,&rdquo;
said Kim with indignation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wanted the papers. Suppose she had stole them? It was only practical
suggestion, I think. You are not pleased, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A native proverb&mdash;unquotable&mdash;showed the blackness of Kim&rsquo;s
disapproval.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;&mdash;Hurree shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;there is
no accounting for thee taste. Mahbub was angry too. He has sold horses all
about here, and he says old lady is <i>pukka</i> (thorough) old lady and would
not condescend to such ungentlemanly things. <i>I</i> do not care. I have got
the papers, and I was very glad of moral support from Mahbub. I tell you, I am
fearful man, but, somehow or other, the more fearful I am the more
dam&rsquo;-tight places I get into. So I was glad you came with me to Chini,
and I am glad Mahbub was close by. The old lady she is sometimes very rude to
me and my beautiful pills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah be merciful!&rdquo; said Kim on his elbow, rejoicing. &ldquo;What
a beast of wonder is a Babu! And that man walked alone&mdash;if he did
walk&mdash;with robbed and angry foreigners!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oah, thatt was nothing, after they had done beating me; but if I lost
the papers it was pretty-jolly serious. Mahbub he nearly beat me too, and he
went and consorted with the lama no end. I shall stick to ethnological
investigations henceforwards. Now good-bye, Mister O&rsquo;Hara. I can catch
4.25 p.m. to Umballa if I am quick. It will be good times when we all tell thee
tale up at Mr Lurgan&rsquo;s. I shall report you offeecially better. Good-bye,
my dear fallow, and when next you are under thee emotions please do not use the
Mohammedan terms with the Tibetan dress.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook hands twice&mdash;a Babu to his boot-heels&mdash;and opened the door.
With the fall of the sunlight upon his still triumphant face he returned to the
humble Dacca quack.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He robbed them,&rdquo; thought Kim, forgetting his own share in the
game. &ldquo;He tricked them. He lied to them like a Bengali. They give him a
<i>chit</i> (a testimonial). He makes them a mock at the risk of his
life&mdash;<i>I</i> never would have gone down to them after the
pistol-shots&mdash;and then he says he is a fearful man ... And he <i>is</i> a
fearful man. I must get into the world again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At first his legs bent like bad pipe-stems, and the flood and rush of the
sunlit air dazzled him. He squatted by the white wall, the mind rummaging among
the incidents of the long <i>dooli</i> journey, the lama&rsquo;s weaknesses,
and, now that the stimulus of talk was removed, his own self-pity, of which,
like the sick, he had great store. The unnerved brain edged away from all the
outside, as a raw horse, once rowelled, sidles from the spur. It was enough,
amply enough, that the spoil of the <i>kilta</i> was away&mdash;off his
hands&mdash;out of his possession. He tried to think of the lama&mdash;to
wonder why he had tumbled into a brook&mdash;but the bigness of the world, seen
between the forecourt gates, swept linked thought aside. Then he looked upon
the trees and the broad fields, with the thatched huts hidden among
crops&mdash;looked with strange eyes unable to take up the size and proportion
and use of things&mdash;stared for a still half-hour. All that while he felt,
though he could not put it into words, that his soul was out of gear with its
surroundings&mdash;a cog-wheel unconnected with any machinery, just like the
idle cog-wheel of a cheap Beheea sugar-crusher laid by in a corner. The breezes
fanned over him, the parrots shrieked at him, the noises of the populated house
behind&mdash;squabbles, orders, and reproofs&mdash;hit on dead ears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am Kim. I am Kim. And what is Kim?&rdquo; His soul repeated it again
and again.
</p>

<p>
He did not want to cry&mdash;had never felt less like crying in his
life&mdash;but of a sudden easy, stupid tears trickled down his nose, and with
an almost audible click he felt the wheels of his being lock up anew on the
world without. Things that rode meaningless on the eyeball an instant before
slid into proper proportion. Roads were meant to be walked upon, houses to be
lived in, cattle to be driven, fields to be tilled, and men and women to be
talked to. They were all real and true&mdash;solidly planted upon the
feet&mdash;perfectly comprehensible&mdash;clay of his clay, neither more nor
less. He shook himself like a dog with a flea in his ear, and rambled out of
the gate. Said the Sahiba, to whom watchful eyes reported this move: &ldquo;Let
him go. I have done my share. Mother Earth must do the rest. When the Holy One
comes back from meditation, tell him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There stood an empty bullock-cart on a little knoll half a mile away, with a
young banyan tree behind&mdash;a look-out, as it were, above some new-ploughed
levels; and his eyelids, bathed in soft air, grew heavy as he neared it. The
ground was good clean dust&mdash;no new herbage that, living, is half-way to
death already, but the hopeful dust that holds the seeds of all life. He felt
it between his toes, patted it with his palms, and joint by joint, sighing
luxuriously, laid him down full length along in the shadow of the wooden-pinned
cart. And Mother Earth was as faithful as the Sahiba. She breathed through him
to restore the poise he had lost lying so long on a cot cut off from her good
currents. His head lay powerless upon her breast, and his opened hands
surrendered to her strength. The many-rooted tree above him, and even the dead
manhandled wood beside, knew what he sought, as he himself did not know. Hour
upon hour he lay deeper than sleep.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening, when the dust of returning kine made all the horizons smoke,
came the lama and Mahbub Ali, both afoot, walking cautiously, for the house had
told them where he had gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah! What a fool&rsquo;s trick to play in open country!&rdquo;
muttered the horse-dealer. &ldquo;He could be shot a hundred times&mdash;but
this is not the Border.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the lama, repeating a many-times-told tale,
&ldquo;never was such a <i>chela</i>. Temperate, kindly, wise, of ungrudging
disposition, a merry heart upon the road, never forgetting, learned, truthful,
courteous. Great is his reward!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know the boy&mdash;as I have said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he was all those things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some of them&mdash;but I have not yet found a Red Hat&rsquo;s charm for
making him overly truthful. He has certainly been well nursed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Sahiba is a heart of gold,&rdquo; said the lama earnestly.
&ldquo;She looks upon him as her son.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hmph! Half Hind seems that way disposed. I only wished to see that the
boy had come to no harm and was a free agent. As thou knowest, he and I were
old friends in the first days of your pilgrimage together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a bond between us.&rdquo; The lama sat down. &ldquo;We are at
the end of the pilgrimage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No thanks to thee thine was not cut off for good and all a week back. I
heard what the Sahiba said to thee when we bore thee up on the cot.&rdquo;
Mahbub laughed, and tugged his newly dyed beard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was meditating upon other matters that tide. It was the <i>hakim</i>
from Dacca broke my meditations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Otherwise&rdquo;&mdash;this was in Pushtu for decency&rsquo;s
sake&mdash;&ldquo;thou wouldst have ended thy meditations upon the sultry side
of Hell&mdash;being an unbeliever and an idolater for all thy child&rsquo;s
simplicity. But now, Red Hat, what is to be done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This very night,&rdquo;&mdash;the words came slowly, vibrating with
triumph&mdash;&ldquo;this very night he will be as free as I am from all taint
of sin&mdash;assured as I am, when he quits this body, of Freedom from the
Wheel of Things. I have a sign&rdquo;&mdash;he laid his hand above the torn
chart in his bosom&mdash;&ldquo;that my time is short; but I shall have
safeguarded him throughout the years. Remember, I have reached Knowledge, as I
told thee only three nights back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must be true, as the Tirah priest said when I stole his
cousin&rsquo;s wife, that I am a <i>sufi</i> (a free-thinker); for here I
sit,&rdquo; said Mahbub to himself, &ldquo;drinking in blasphemy unthinkable
... I remember the tale. On that, then, he goes to <i>Jannatu l&rsquo;Adn</i>
(the Gardens of Eden). But how? Wilt thou slay him or drown him in that
wonderful river from which the Babu dragged thee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was dragged from no river,&rdquo; said the lama simply. &ldquo;Thou
hast forgotten what befell. I found it by Knowledge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, ay. True,&rdquo; stammered Mahbub, divided between high indignation
and enormous mirth. &ldquo;I had forgotten the exact run of what happened. Thou
didst find it knowingly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And to say that I would take life is&mdash;not a sin, but a madness
simple. My <i>chela</i> aided me to the River. It is his right to be cleansed
from sin&mdash;with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, he needs cleansing. But afterwards, old man&mdash;afterwards?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What matter under all the Heavens? He is sure of
Nibban&mdash;enlightened&mdash;as I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well said. I had a fear he might mount Mohammed&rsquo;s Horse and fly
away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay&mdash;he must go forth as a teacher.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aha! Now I see! That is the right gait for the colt. Certainly he must
go forth as a teacher. He is somewhat urgently needed as a scribe by the State,
for instance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To that end he was prepared. I acquired merit in that I gave alms for
his sake. A good deed does not die. He aided me in my Search. I aided him in
his. Just is the Wheel, O horse-seller from the North. Let him be a teacher;
let him be a scribe&mdash;what matter? He will have attained Freedom at the
end. The rest is illusion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What matter? When I must have him with me beyond Balkh in six months! I
come up with ten lame horses and three strong-backed men&mdash;thanks to that
chicken of a Babu&mdash;to break a sick boy by force out of an old trot&rsquo;s
house. It seems that I stand by while a young Sahib is hoisted into Allah knows
what of an idolater&rsquo;s Heaven by means of old Red Hat. And I am reckoned
something of a player of the Game myself! But the madman is fond of the boy;
and I must be very reasonably mad too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the prayer?&rdquo; said the lama, as the rough Pushtu rumbled
into the red beard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No matter at all; but now I understand that the boy, sure of Paradise,
can yet enter Government service, my mind is easier. I must get to my horses.
It grows dark. Do not wake him. I have no wish to hear him call thee
master.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he <i>is</i> my disciple. What else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has told me.&rdquo; Mahbub choked down his touch of spleen and rose
laughing. &ldquo;I am not altogether of thy faith, Red Hat&mdash;if so small a
matter concern thee.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; said the lama.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought not. Therefore it will not move thee, sinless, new-washed and
three parts drowned to boot, when I call thee a good man&mdash;a very good man.
We have talked together some four or five evenings now, and for all I am a
horse-coper I can still, as the saying is, see holiness beyond the legs of a
horse. Yea, can see, too, how our Friend of all the World put his hand in thine
at the first. Use him well, and suffer him to return to the world as a teacher,
when thou hast&mdash;bathed his legs, if that be the proper medicine for the
colt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not follow the Way thyself, and so accompany the boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mahbub stared stupefied at the magnificent insolence of the demand, which
across the Border he would have paid with more than a blow. Then the humour of
it touched his worldly soul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Softly&mdash;softly&mdash;one foot at a time, as the lame gelding went
over the Umballa jumps. I may come to Paradise later&mdash;I have workings that
way&mdash;great motions&mdash;and I owe them to thy simplicity. Thou hast never
lied?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What need?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Allah, hear him! &lsquo;What need&rsquo; in this Thy world! Nor ever
harmed a man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Once&mdash;with a pencase&mdash;before I was wise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So? I think the better of thee. Thy teachings are good. Thou hast turned
one man that I know from the path of strife.&rdquo; He laughed immensely.
&ldquo;He came here open-minded to commit a <i>dacoity</i> (a house-robbery
with violence). Yes, to cut, rob, kill, and carry off what he desired.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A great foolishness!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! black shame too. So he thought after he had seen thee&mdash;and a
few others, male and female. So he abandoned it; and now he goes to beat a big
fat Babu man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah forbid it! Some men are strong in knowledge, Red Hat. Thy strength
is stronger still. Keep it&mdash;I think thou wilt. If the boy be not a good
servant, pull his ears off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a hitch of his broad Bokhariot belt the Pathan swaggered off into the
gloaming, and the lama came down from his clouds so far as to look at the broad
back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That person lacks courtesy, and is deceived by the shadow of
appearances. But he spoke well of my <i>chela</i>, who now enters upon his
reward. Let me make the prayer! ... Wake, O fortunate above all born of women.
Wake! It is found!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kim came up from those deep wells, and the lama attended his yawning pleasure;
duly snapping fingers to head off evil spirits.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have slept a hundred years. Where&mdash;? Holy One, hast <i>thou</i>
been here long? I went out to look for thee, but&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed
drowsily&mdash;&ldquo;I slept by the way. I am all well now. Hast thou eaten?
Let us go to the house. It is many days since I tended thee. And the Sahiba fed
thee well? Who shampooed thy legs? What of the weaknesses&mdash;the belly and
the neck, and the beating in the ears?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gone&mdash;all gone. Dost thou not know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know nothing, but that I have not seen thee in a monkey&rsquo;s age.
Know what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Strange the knowledge did not reach out to thee, when all my thoughts
were theeward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot see the face, but the voice is like a gong. Has the Sahiba made
a young man of thee by her cookery?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He peered at the cross-legged figure, outlined jet-black against the
lemon-coloured drift of light. So does the stone Bodhisat sit who looks down
upon the patent self-registering turnstiles of the Lahore Museum.
</p>

<p>
The lama held his peace. Except for the click of the rosary and a faint
<i>clop-clop</i> of Mahbub&rsquo;s retreating feet, the soft, smoky silence of
evening in India wrapped them close.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear me! I bring news.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But let us&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Out shot the long yellow hand compelling silence. Kim tucked his feet under his
robe-edge obediently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hear me! I bring news! The Search is finished. Comes now the Reward...
Thus. When we were among the Hills, I lived on thy strength till the young
branch bowed and nigh broke. When we came out of the Hills, I was troubled for
thee and for other matters which I held in my heart. The boat of my soul lacked
direction; I could not see into the Cause of Things. So I gave thee over to the
virtuous woman altogether. I took no food. I drank no water. Still I saw not
the Way. They pressed food upon me and cried at my shut door. So I removed
myself to a hollow under a tree. I took no food. I took no water. I sat in
meditation two days and two nights, abstracting my mind; inbreathing and
outbreathing in the required manner ... Upon the second night&mdash;so great
was my reward&mdash;the wise Soul loosed itself from the silly Body and went
free. This I have never before attained, though I have stood on the threshold
of it. Consider, for it is a marvel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A marvel indeed. Two days and two nights without food! Where was the
Sahiba?&rdquo; said Kim under his breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yea, my Soul went free, and, wheeling like an eagle, saw indeed that
there was no Teshoo Lama nor any other soul. As a drop draws to water, so my
Soul drew near to the Great Soul which is beyond all things. At that point,
exalted in contemplation, I saw all Hind, from Ceylon in the sea to the Hills,
and my own Painted Rocks at Such-zen; I saw every camp and village, to the
least, where we have ever rested. I saw them at one time and in one place; for
they were within the Soul. By this I knew the Soul had passed beyond the
illusion of Time and Space and of Things. By this I knew that I was free. I saw
thee lying in thy cot, and I saw thee falling downhill under the
idolater&mdash;at one time, in one place, in my Soul, which, as I say, had
touched the Great Soul. Also I saw the stupid body of Teshoo Lama lying down,
and the <i>hakim</i> from Dacca kneeled beside, shouting in its ear. Then my
Soul was all alone, and I saw nothing, for I was all things, having reached the
Great Soul. And I meditated a thousand thousand years, passionless, well aware
of the Causes of all Things. Then a voice cried: &lsquo;What shall come to the
boy if thou art dead?&rsquo; and I was shaken back and forth in myself with
pity for thee; and I said: &lsquo;I will return to my <i>chela</i>, lest he
miss the Way.&rsquo; Upon this my Soul, which is the Soul of Teshoo Lama,
withdrew itself from the Great Soul with strivings and yearnings and retchings
and agonies not to be told. As the egg from the fish, as the fish from the
water, as the water from the cloud, as the cloud from the thick air, so put
forth, so leaped out, so drew away, so fumed up the Soul of Teshoo Lama from
the Great Soul. Then a voice cried: &lsquo;The River! Take heed to the
River!&rsquo; and I looked down upon all the world, which was as I had seen it
before&mdash;one in time, one in place&mdash;and I saw plainly the River of the
Arrow at my feet. At that hour my Soul was hampered by some evil or other
whereof I was not wholly cleansed, and it lay upon my arms and coiled round my
waist; but I put it aside, and I cast forth as an eagle in my flight for the
very place of the River. I pushed aside world upon world for thy sake. I saw
the River below me&mdash;the River of the Arrow&mdash;and, descending, the
waters of it closed over me; and behold I was again in the body of Teshoo Lama,
but free from sin, and the <i>hakim</i> from Decca bore up my head in the
waters of the River. It is here! It is behind the mango-tope here&mdash;even
here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah kerim! Oh, well that the Babu was by! Wast thou very wet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I regard? I remember the <i>hakim</i> was concerned for the
body of Teshoo Lama. He haled it out of the holy water in his hands, and there
came afterwards thy horse-seller from the North with a cot and men, and they
put the body on the cot and bore it up to the Sahiba&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What said the Sahiba?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was meditating in that body, and did not hear. So thus the Search is
ended. For the merit that I have acquired, the River of the Arrow is here. It
broke forth at our feet, as I have said. I have found it. Son of my Soul, I
have wrenched my Soul back from the Threshold of Freedom to free thee from all
sin&mdash;as I am free, and sinless! Just is the Wheel! Certain is our
deliverance! Come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He crossed his hands on his lap and smiled, as a man may who has won salvation
for himself and his beloved.
